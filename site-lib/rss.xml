It was a recognition. As if the cold, dark fragment had finally noticed the frequency of the Ouroboros and found a matching vibration in the void. My left eye—the bleeding one—twitched with a violent, electric spasm.The world didn't just flicker; it inverted.For one shattering nanosecond, the hospice room was gone. Papa was gone. The Ouroboros was gone. I wasn't standing on a floor. I wasn't breathing air. I was—Nothing.My skin registered temperature, but wrong—a burning cold that felt like being dipped in liquid nitrogen and expecting flames. Every hair follicle screamed. I tried to shiver but my body had forgotten the reflex; there was no warmth to conserve, no core to protect. Just an absence so complete it had texture—like running your fingers across the surface of a silence that had killed every sound that ever existed.It wasn't darkness. Darkness implies a lack of light, a shadow cast by a presence. This was the absolute absence of everything that had ever been. It was an infinity that had already forgotten the stars. A patience so vast it made the geological history of Terra feel like a frantic, passing thought.I felt something watching. Not with eyes—eyes would have been a comfort. This was attention without organs, awareness without origin. It pressed against the edges of my consciousness the way a glacier presses against a pebble. Patient. Heavy. Older than etymology.I tried to scream. My throat contracted, my diaphragm seized, my mouth opened—but no sound emerged. My body had forgotten the reflex to vocalize. In this place, sound had never been invented. I clawed at the absence with a reflex that no longer had meaning.I tasted the fine, grey dust of a universe that had run out of fuel billions of years ago and was merely waiting for the final cooling to finish. Ashes of stars that had names no one would ever speak. There was no "Soul-Engine." There were no "25 million souls." There was only the End.And in that End, there was a presence.It didn't have a face. It didn't have a name. It didn't have a voice. But it was there, waiting at the terminus of every possible timeline. It wasn't predatory. It wasn't evil. It was simply... inevitable. And it was connected to me.The Ouroboros behind my head wasn't a weapon I'd forged. It was a tether. A thin, recursive line of ink and gold that stretched from my chest across the impossible distance to that final silence.The trauma of the contact wasn't emotional. It was structural. My identity, already thinned by the memory-trade, couldn't handle the weight of that much Nothing.The vision released me——and I came back wrong.My legs gave out. Not buckled—gave out, like the signal from brain to limb had been scrambled in transmission. I crashed to the linoleum hard enough to jar my teeth, hard enough to feel the cold of the floor slam through my palms and into my shoulder blades. For three terrible seconds, I couldn't feel where my limbs were. Proprioception had failed. I was a consciousness floating somewhere near a body that had forgotten its own geography.Then the vomiting.Not the dignified heave of a sick man—a thin, acidic stream of bile that splattered across the linoleum, across my hands, pooling against my knees. It tasted of copper and ash and something else, something that didn't belong in human chemistry. My eyes watered. Snot joined the bile. I made a sound—not a retch, not a cough—a whimper. The noise a dog makes when it's been hit by a car and doesn't understand why everything hurts.I wasn't just shaking. My cells were struggling to remember how to be matter. Somewhere in the span between the void and the hospice floor, I had forgotten the molecular instructions for existing.I didn't understand what I'd touched. I didn't know the name of the abyss. But I knew, with a certainty that bypassed every clinical defense I had left, that I had just looked into the mouth of the thing that was coming for all of us. And I had recognized it as a mirror."Beta?"Papa's voice cut through the horror, sounding like it was coming from the other side of a vast canyon. The vision retreated, but it didn't disappear. It stayed in the corner of my eye, a flickering patch of unrendered space that refused to resolve.I looked at my hands. Still trembling. Still slightly translucent. Bile cooling between my fingers.I was no longer just saving my father. I was becoming an anchor for the end of the world.I reached out blindly, my fingers scrabbling against the cold hospital linoleum until they found the metal rail of the bed. I pulled myself up, my muscles feeling like they were composed of wet sand, until I could feel the heat of Papa's hand again.It was the only thing in the world that felt real. Everything else—the room, the shadows, the "Conceptual Zero" vibrating in the corners—it was all just data. Corrupted, flickering data. But the warmth of his fingers was an anchor. A hard, physical constant in a universe that was currently de-rendering around me.Behind my head, the Ouroboros began to stabilize. The frantic, stuttering rotation smoothed into a heavy, rhythmic yaw. The gold syntax-traceries stopped flickering and settled into a steady, low-level hum. I could feel the "Render Load" easing, the localized gravity well dissipating as the spell found its equilibrium.The cost had been paid. The initial transaction was complete. Now all that remained was the debt-service—the stolen minutes I’d bought with the ruins of my heart."I'm here," I rasped. My voice sounded like it had been dragged through a gravel pit. "I'm still here, Papa."Papa was watching me with a tragic kind of pride, his engineer-mind finally accepting the bridge I’d built, even if he knew the materials were compromised."You went somewhere, beta," he whispered. He weakly squeezed my wrist. "For a few seconds, you... you weren't here. You were looking at the math on the other side."I forced a smile, though it felt like a texture map being stretched too thin across my face. "I saw the terminus, Papa. I saw where the lines end.""And?""And it's empty," I admitted, my voice dropping to a whisper. "It's just... quiet. Perfectly quiet."Papa’s eyes softened. "Then we shouldn't waste our noise, beta. We have a borrowed hour. Don't spend it staring into the dark."I settled into the vinyl chair, my knees still shaking, and leaned closer. He was right. The Abyss could wait. The "Conceptual Zero" could wait. I wanted the heat of his hand and the sound of his voice. I wanted the nineteen years of missed conversations to start now."Tell me about Maa," I said, the words a desperate attempt to anchor us both to the world that was still rendering. "Tell me about the time she tried to make that cardamom cake and set the kitchen on fire. I... I can't quite feel the warmth of that memory anymore."Papa laughed—a real, genuine sound that cut through the silence of the ward like a bell. "Oh, beta. That wasn't a fire. That was a meltdown."And for the first time in three years, we actually talked. Really talked. Not about the clinic, not about my expulsion, not about the war in the Vatican, but about the small, stupid, human things that the universe was currently trying its best to delete.Papa leaned back against the hospital pillows, his chest rising and falling with a shallow, rhythmic wheeze that my bones transcribed as "Interest Accruing.""You remember the Keshava Bridge, Bodhi? The one we built in the Southern Sector when you were ten?"I nodded, the memory flickering with a dull, grey jitter. I remembered the heat of the sun on the steel girders, the smell of hot tar, the way the wind would whistle through the suspension cables. But the awe I’d felt—the way I used to look up at those massive arcs and think Papa was a wizard of iron—was already gone. It was just a data-point now. A bridge. Made of metal. In the south."You remember how the wind sounded in the cables?" Papa asked, his voice barely a rasp. "It wasn't whistling, Bodhi. It was singing.""The wind shears off the struts," I said, reciting the textbook definition I’d learned in his study. "Aeroelastic flutter. It creates a vortex.""No," Papa said, closing his eyes. "That's the math. That's the excuse the engineers tell themselves so they can sleep at night. But the bridge wasn't strong because we poured more concrete, beta. It was strong because we let it move. We built the weakness into the design."He opened his eyes, and for a second, the dementia fog cleared completely. I saw the man who had taught me to read blueprints before I could read books."Every structure has a frequency," he whispered, his eyes distant as if calculating the shear strength of the ceiling tiles. "A point where it wants to vibrate. The Keshava Bridge... if you hit it with a hammer in the wrong spot, nothing happens. But if you find the connection point—the place where the tension meets the load—you don't need a thousand tons of force. You just need a single, well-placed vibration. You can move a mountain if you know where the system is weakest.""Resonance," I murmured."Resonance," he agreed. "The Akasha, the Vatican, this Ouroboros you've got spinning behind your head... it thinks it's stone. It thinks it's absolute. But it's just geometry, Bodhi. It's just load-bearing code."He turned his focus back to me, his gaze sharpening into something diamond-hard."I spent forty years calculating margins of error. Do you know what I learned? Perfection is brittle. The harder they try to make the system static—the harder they try to freeze the world into their image—the more kinetic energy acts as a poison."I looked at the Ouroboros. Perfection is brittle. It was tactical advice disguised as engineering philosophy. He wasn't talking about bridges. He was talking about The System. He was talking about the God-Machine that was currently eating my memories to fuel his heartbeats."It's too heavy, Papa," I said, my voice cracking. "The debt... I can feel it eating the edges of everything. I don't know how to stay 'me' and keep this going."Papa’s hand found mine again. His grip was shivering now, the biological hardware of his body struggling to maintain its connection to the soul-instance I’d patched onto it."Then don't try to be the whole bridge, beta. Be the vibration. Be the unhandled exception. The universe is a vast, rigid architecture, Bodhi. It’s built to withstand pressure, but it’s terrified of resonance. Don't fight their walls. Find the hairline fracture they painted over. Find the resonance point where the math doesn't add up."He leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, as if we were back in his study planning a heist on the laws of physics."And then... just push."He coughed, and this time, the Ouroboros didn't just flare—it glitched. A violent, jagged spike of violet light tore through the privacy curtain, de-rendering a three-foot section of the wall beside the bed into absolute black.Papa didn't even blink. He was watching me with an intensity that made the golden-black voids of my eyes burn. "Resonance, Bodhi. Resonance is how you break the debt. It's how you... you..." His voice trailed off, his jaw working as if he’d forgotten the next word in the sequence. The "Conceptual Zero" in his neural pathways was accelerating. The stolen hour was reaching its final partition.The somatic thrum in my marrow increased in frequency, a rapid-fire staccato that made my teeth ache. One-two-three-four.Thirty-one minutes left."You're tired, Papa," I whispered, my voice coming out hoarse, barely audible over the machinery. "Just... rest for a second. We have time.""No," he said, the word a final, heavy strike of a hammer. "We don't. You have work to do, beta. You have a system to dismantle. And you have to do it before there's nothing left of you to remember why you started."He closed his eyes, his breathing settling into a slow, labored rhythm. I stayed there, holding his shivering hand, watching the Ouroboros spin and the shadows crawl, and the word Resonance echoed in my head like a virus.I realized then that he wasn't just giving me advice. He was giving me my first mission. He was handing me the key to the very cage I’d just locked myself into.The final beat came without fanfare.One pulse in my marrow—a heavy, tectonic thud—and then silence.The Ouroboros behind my head didn't exhaust itself; it simply dispersed. The ink-fluid mass thinned into a fine, black mist, and the violet light began to fail, the room flickering back toward the harsh, indifferent grey of the hospice ward.The world was re-rendering.I watched the clarity drain from Papa's eyes like water from a cracked vessel. The recognition that had burned so bright guttered. His skeletal hand went slack in mine."Beta?" His voice was thin, confused, the polite, distant stranger returning to reclaim the instance."I'm here, Papa," I whispered, my voice breaking. "I'm right here."He blinked at me. Slow. Confused. Then his lips moved, shaping a word that hit me harder than the silence."Nalini?"The name was a shotgun blast to the sternum. He wasn't looking at me. He was looking through me. Searching for a face that had been dead for three years in features that must have looked enough like hers."No, Papa." My throat was so tight I could barely form words. "It's Bodhi. Your son."But his gaze was already sliding past me, settling on the empty space near the window where the light caught the dust motes. He smiled—a soft, distant thing—and his eyes cleared with a different kind of recognition."There you are," he murmured to the empty air. "I've been waiting."He wasn't talking to me. He was talking to a ghost.I sat there, holding his cooling hand, and tried to picture my mother's face. The woman I'd been compared to my entire life. The woman whose death I'd mourned for three years.I summoned the memory of the cardamom cake—the one we’d just laughed about.It came up clear at first. I could smell the sweet, warm spice. I could see the flour on her cheek, the way the sunlight hit the dust motes in the kitchen. I could feel the heat of the oven vent against my legs.Payment Required, the Ouroboros whispered in the silence of my blood.I didn't want to let go. I wanted to hoard it. But Papa’s hand was getting cold in mine, and the silence was creeping back into the room.I closed my eyes and pushed.It wasn't a passive loss. It was an amputation. I felt the memory slide out of my grasp, pulled by the gravity of the spell.The smell of cardamom didn't just fade; it turned to dust. Dry, grey, tasteless dust. The warmth of the kitchen vent became a stinging cold.Then the visual data began to rot.Her face, which had been high-resolution a second ago, pixelated. The eyes desynced, sliding off the geometry of her face. The audio of her humming slowed down, warping into a deep, guttural drone that sounded like a machine failing.Glitch. Static. Null.I tried to hold onto the emotion—the love, the frustration of the burnt cake, the sound of her laughter. But the metadata was stripped away. The emotional context was deleted, leaving only the raw, objective facts.Subject: Nalini Rao.
Event: Cooking.
Outcome: Fire.I viewed the file, and I felt nothing. It was like looking at a Stranger's passport photo. The grief, the love, the aching absence that had defined me for three years—it was gone. Harvested.I had fed the only thing that made me her son to the Ouroboros in exchange for sixty minutes that had ended with my father calling me by her name.The universe's arithmetic had balanced.I'd bought Papa an hour of lucidity with the only thing that made an hour of lucidity matter.Stolen heartbeats. That's what I'd bought. Not saved—stolen.One stolen heartbeat. Two. Three.I stayed by the bed, my hand still gripping his, as the last of the violet light evaporated and the shadows reclaimed the room. I didn't leave. I couldn't.I just watched the fading afterimage of the Ouroboros and waited for the bill to come due.The silence that followed the Ouroboros didn't last. It couldn't. The universe abhors a vacuum, but bureaucracy abhors a discrepancy even more.Bang. Bang. Bang.The fists slamming against the door of Ward 404 weren't frantic. They were heavy, rhythmic, and authoritative. They sounded like the gavel of the reality I had just tried to dismantled coming back to pass sentence."Open up," a voice boomed from the corridor. Not Soldatos. Not the tactical bark of Marco Cavaretta’s enforcers. This was lower, flatter. The bored, terrifying indifference of the hospital administration. "Asset Retrieval. We have a pickup order for Subject 881-R."Asset.The word hung in the sterile air, more offensive than any curse. They weren't coming for a patient. They weren't coming for my father. They were coming for a piece of expired inventory.I looked down at Papa. He was still there—the shell of him, at least. The cooling hand I was still gripping, the chest that had stopped rising, the face that had, for one confusing second, mistaken me for the wife he’d lost three years ago."Open the door, Mr. Rao. We know you're in there. Protocol mandates immediate processing."Processing.I knew what that meant. I’d worked in the clinic. I knew the efficiency of the New Canaan cremation incinerators. I knew how quickly a life was reduced to ash and a database update."No," I whispered.It wasn't a defiance. It was a simple statement of fact. A rejection of the script.The handle rattled. Then a key slid into the lock with the screech of metal on metal.I looked at the empty air where the Ouroboros had been. I looked at the shadows lingering in the corners of the room—the "Conceptual Zero" that hadn't quite faded. And I looked at the gold wedding band on my left hand—Maa's ring. The dead, cold circle of grief.I couldn't let them take him. I couldn't let them turn the warmth of his hand into ash.The lock tumbled. The door handle turned.I didn't think. I didn't calculate. The clinical detachment that had piloted me through the last hour fractured, revealing the desperate, terrified son beneath.I grabbed the ring from my finger—fumbled it, almost dropped it, caught it against my chest with a frantic, clawing grip. And then I spoke the word again.Not the full incantation. Not the poem. Just the command. The function call."DISMANTLE."This time, I didn't target the room. I didn't target the dementia. I targeted the distance. I targeted the separation between the vessel on the bed and the object in my hand.Collapse, I willed it. Collapse the probability.The world didn't just invert this time; it bleached.A flash of Absolute White—not light, but the overload of every sensor in my body hitting maximum simultaneously—erased the room. The sound of the door opening was swallowed. The smell of the jungle-rot was cauterized. For a single heartbeat, there was no hospital, no Papa, no me. There was only the white, humming silence of a file being overwritten.And then, heat.Scorching, blinding heat against my palm.The whiteout snapped off.I was on my knees. My hand was clenched against my chest, screaming in pain, as if I’d just grabbed a falling star. The scent of burnt sugar and static filled the air.I didn't look at the bed. I couldn't. The panic was a physical thing now, a flock of birds trapped in my ribcage. I scrambled backward, crab-walking across the linoleum, my breath coming in short, jagged gasps.The door swung open.Two orderlies stepped in—hulking shapes in pastel blue scrubs, dragging a retrieval gurney between them.I didn't wait to see what they saw. I didn't wait for the questions. I turned toward the window I’d cracked earlier. My left hand was a radiating kiln; as I neared the glass, the thermal spike hit the cold night air outside. The pane didn't wait for my weight—it crazed instantly, spider-webbing into a million fractures before I even made contact. I went through it in a cloud of glass-dust, hitting the iron of the fire escape with a bone-jarring rattle.The night air hit me like a physical blow—cold, wet, smelling of city rain and exhaust. But it felt real. It felt rendered.I scrambled down the metal stairs, the iron ringing under my boots, my left hand still clenched tight against my chest, guarding the searing, pulsing heat that was burning a hole through my shirt.I ran.I scrambled down the metal stairs, my left hand guarding the searing heat against my chest. I paused on the first landing, lungs burning, and looked back.Through the window I'd just shattered, a sound began to rise—a wet, rapid-cycle tearing, like a thousand vines unfurling at once. Then the shouting."What the hell..." a muffled voice cried. "Jackson, get back! It's... it's moss!"A thick, sappy-white vine snaked out of the broken window, coiling around the iron railing of the fire escape. It bloomed in seconds, a bioluminescent orchid opening its petals against the cold rain.I didn't wait to hear the rest of the orderlies' screaming. I turned to run, but the "Garden" wasn't just in the room. It was leaking. The iron grate of the fire escape was slick—not with rain, but with a carpet of velvet-black moss that was growing aggressively over the rust. The handrail under my grip groaned, the metal warping, twisting, hardening into the knurled bark of an ironwood branch. The infection was structural. Below me, beams of tactical light cut through the rain. "Perimeter breach, North Face," a hard voice crackled from the courtyard. "I've got heat signatures spiking on the fourth floor." Asset Retrieval. They were already moving to cordon the building. I pressed my left hand harder against my chest, smothering the neutron-star glow of the Ring under my jacket. The heat seared my skin, a constant, blistering reminder of what I was carrying, but I couldn't let them see the light. I was a lighthouse in a blackout. I moved fast, boots skidding on the treacherous moss. Too fast. On the second landing, the reshaped "wood" of the stairs gave way. My heel caught a patch of slime-coated lichen. I went down. The world tilted violently. The impact jarred my arm, breaking the seal of my jacket. The Ring—obsidian and burning gold—slipped from my grip. Time dilated. I saw it tumbling through the rain, a streak of impossible fire falling toward the grate. If it hit the metal, it would ring like a bell. If it fell through the gaps, it was gone. I had a microsecond to choose: grab the railing and save my ribs, or dive for the Ring. I didn't think. I dove. I ignored the railing. I threw my body forward, sliding uncontrollably across the moss. My right hand scrambled for purchase and found nothing but slime; my left snatched the Ring out of the air just inches from the edge. I slammed into the corner post of the landing with a sickening *crunch*. Air left my lungs. My ribs screamed. For a second, I just hung there, draped over the iron beams, gasping for breath that wouldn't come. But I had the Ring. It was safe in my fist, burning, pulsing, alive. "Movement! Sector 2!" The beam swept up, missing me by inches. I forced myself up. I didn't have time for pain. I vaulted the last flight of stairs, landing in the alleyway mud with a heavy splash. I didn't get far. A crackle of static stopped me.
It was coming from above—or maybe from a dropped radio on the fire escape. The voice was tinny, bored, and amplified by the narrow brick canyon."Hey Haas, are you on the fourth floor?"A sound of raucous, heaving coughing answered. Wet, uncontrolled."You realize taking a 'smoke break' doesn't mean you can just face an entire blunt in the front gardens, dude."More coughing."It's medicinal, Jimenez," the second voice wheezed."Oh yeah, sure, I forgot you had a script for 'night blindness' or whatever the fuck," Jimenez replied, the sarcasm dripping even through the static."Bite meee—" The voice trailed off into another fit.I should have run. Every instinct I had screamed move. But the sheer, aggressive absurdity of the conversation rooted me to the spot. It was too mundane. Too stupid. The universe was tearing itself apart upstairs, and these two were arguing about weed."Cool, well when you catch your breath, can you confirm the status of Subject 881-R for Municipal Transfer?" Jimenez asked. "I'm getting weird reports from Jackson on that floor.""Yeah. Give me five."I needed to see. The compulsion hit me like an itch behind the eyes. I leaned against the wet brick, shifting the Burning Ring to my thumb, and traced a quick, jagged sigil in the condensation on the wall. A thief’s cantrip. A Scrying Frame.The brick seemed to dissolve, replaced by a flickering, grayscale view of Ward 404 from the perspective of a security feed."Hey Jimenez," Haas’s voice came over the radio, synchronized with the figure I saw stumbling into the doorway in the vision. "Yeah... I'm actually on the Fourth Floor right now...""Oh, that's great!" Jimenez chirped. "Do you need a gurney for the transfer, or are you and Jackson all set?"Haas stopped dead in the doorway. "I... I don't know...""Sounds good th—...Wait. What do you mean 'I don't know'?""I can't find them," Haas said, his voice trembling. "There's only plants."I watched, mesmerized, as Haas spun in a slow circle. The room wasn't a room anymore. It was a jungle."What do you mean 'There's only plants'?!" Jimenez shouted."It MEANS there's only PLANTS!""Are you still smoking in the gardens, you clown? Go to ROOM 404!""I AM on the fourth floor!" Haas yelled at his shoulder mic, throwing his hands up. "I am STANDING in his ROOM.""AND?""AND you don't have to SHOUT at me!""WHAT'S IN HIS ROOM?""There's more plants!""WHAT?""There's just more plants! Oh, hey Jackson. Jackson's just sitting in the corner."I shifted the scrying angle. Jackson was indeed in the corner. Or rather, he was part of the corner, wrapped in a cocoon of flowering ivy."CHECK the BED," Jimenez commanded.I watched Haas approach the bed. The sheets rustled as he pulled them back."There's still plants!""WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?""APPARENTLY I'M AT 'PLANTS'!" Haas screamed, tearing his cap off. "Screw it, Jackson is babbling, I'm strapping them to the gurney.""WHY ARE YOU STRAPPING JACKSON TO THE GURNEY?""FUCK. YOU."The scry flickered, but not before I saw it. The thing on the bed. The "Memento Mori" effigy of Papa, rendered in chlorophyll and cellulose. It didn't look dead. It looked... blooming. A dark purple flower opened where his heart should have been, pulsing with a slow, biological rhythm.I cut the connection. The brick wall rushed back.I started to laugh.It bubbled up from my chest, a jagged, broken sound that hurt my throat. It wasn't funny. It was horrific. It was the end of my life. But the image of Haas screaming "I'M AT PLANTS" while my dad turned into a goddamn botanical garden was too much for the structural integrity of my mind to handle.I laughed until I couldn't breathe. I laughed until my knees gave out and I slid down the wall into the mud. And then, without any transition at all, the laughter shattered.I curled into a ball in the filth of the alley, clutching the burning ring to my chest, and sobbed. I sobbed for the plants. I sobbed for the good and bad that I had lost for a mere hour. I sobbed for the thief, the monster, and the god who was currently crying in a pile of garbage because he’d finally performed a miracle, and it was a punchline.]]></description><link>manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-09-draft.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Projects/Writing/Books/The Cleric Saga/_bmad-output/manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-09-draft.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 18:27:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[chapter-08-draft]]></title><description><![CDATA[Room 404 smelled of industrial sanitizer and the ghost of jasmine—his favorite. The monitors pulsed their steady, accusing blue. My father lay beneath a thin sheet, a topology of bones.The decision had been made. Somewhere between the flat-line warning and my mother's voice in my head, I'd crossed a line that couldn't be uncrossed.I gripped his hand tighter, my fingers interlacing with cold, papery skin that felt like it might crumble under pressure. I closed my eyes and pushed.It was pure will. I didn't have time for the ritual structure the Academy drilled into us, nor the convenient fictions of gods I’d abandoned years ago. It was just raw intention forcing my own mana into the bond between us.Mana was the fuel. Memory was the bill. I was spending both.The connection was instant—a burning ligature binding his failing system and my desperate attempt to stabilize it. The moment it locked in, I felt the cost. Nausea rose like a wave, crashing against the back of my throat. Copper flooded my tongue—the taste of magic pushed past safe limits. My vision tunneled at the edges, the room compressing into a narrow cone of focus centered on his face.A spike of fever-heat radiated from the center of my chest, expanding outward into my limbs. It was a cellular fire, the price of channeling more power than my body was designed to handle.The rune wards on my forearms began to smolder.The sickening copper-tang of burning flesh mixing with carbonized ink filled the air before the smoke even registered. Thin wisps of smoke curled up from the black script, visible even in the dim blue light. The wards were designed to protect against exactly this kind of overload. They were failing.A high-pitched whine filled the air—not from the charm this time, but from the magic itself. The sound of reality straining against my will, the universe protesting the transaction I was forcing it to accept.Pain seared from my wrists to my elbows. Blinding. Immediate. Like someone had poured molten metal into channels carved along my bones. My muscles cramped violently—fingers spasming against his hand, forearm seizing up in a knot of agony that nearly broke my grip.But I didn't let go.The room tilted. Slid sideways. Steadied. The smoke from my arms thickened, the smell of charred meat and ionized particulates filling my nostrils.I was overclocking my soul. Forcing biological and magical systems to run at frequencies they were never meant to handle. Every safety threshold the Academy had built into my training—every limiter in my student ID, every protective measure coded into my aura signature—I was burning through them like tissue paper in a furnace.And it was working.The power flowed out of me in a torrent—life-force, raw and hemorrhaging into his failing systems. It stitched the gaps, stabilizing the collapse, holding back the void that was trying to claim him.The flatline graph on the monitor—when had it flatlined? I hadn't even noticed—bounced back. A weak line appeared. A rhythm. Not strong, not healthy, but present.The smell of crushed jasmine flooded the room—bizarre, pleasant, utterly incongruous. A side effect of extreme magical strain. The Academy had warned about it: your senses cross-wire when you push too hard, and suddenly everything smells like flowers while your bones turn to ash.The monitors stabilized. Blue replaced red. The alarms went silent.But the price hit immediately.A vast, empty hollowness opened in my core—as if a chunk of my soul, something essential and irreplaceable, had been ripped out and fed to the machine. I swayed on my feet, vision tunneling again, the room spinning around a fixed point somewhere behind my eyes.My smoking tattoos hissed faintly, the burned ink still radiating heat.I sank back into the chair, body trembling with the aftershocks of what I'd done. I had won a single battle.The war was far from over.The initial surge faded, and the weight of what I'd done descended like a physical force pressing against my skull.Reality was a ledger. I'd learned that a long time ago—back at the Academy, back when I still believed the system could be worked within. Every transaction required balance. Every action had a cost. And magic, because it bent the rules that everything else had to follow, carried the highest interest rates of all.The universe compressed around me, trying to reclaim what I'd stolen from it. A crushing, invisible pressure building behind my eyes, in my teeth, along my spine. Disorder wanted its due. I'd cheated it, temporarily, but the bill was coming.His eyelids flickered.I froze. Stared. The movement had been tiny—a small, involuntary twitch, barely visible. But I'd seen it. The faintest stirring of consciousness somewhere deep in the architecture of his mind, a signal propagating through damaged nerves.The heartbeat on the monitor was weak but present. A thin green line, trembling at the edge of visibility, but drawing itself over and over against the darkness of the screen.I had bought him time. But the cost—The strain on my soul was immense. It felt like being stretched between two tectonic plates slowly pulling apart, each passing second increasing the tension, the damage. I tried to raise my right hand and found that it was shaking uncontrollably—a tremor starting in my fingers and radiating up to my wrist, my forearm, my elbow. Fine motor control was gone. I couldn't have held a pen if my life depended on it.I looked at my fingertips. I couldn't feel them. The sensation ended somewhere around my wrists, a numbness spreading where there should have been touch. The skin along my forearms had cracked—I could see it now, hairline fractures spreading through the black ink like shattered glass. The protective magic that was supposed to regulate my output had been overwhelmed. Burned through. The channels were damaged in ways I couldn't assess without proper scanning equipment.The jasmine scent faded from the room, replaced by the creeping smell of biological decay—not from him, but from me. From the parts of myself I'd burned to buy these minutes.Yet I refused to let go of his hand.Desperation was a fuel now. A dark, bitter energy that I fed back into the loop, recycled from pain into purpose. I was on the edge of a cliff, and I could feel the rocks crumbling beneath my feet, but the alternative—watching him flatline while I sat passive in a vinyl chair—was not acceptable. Would never be acceptable.So I did something stupid."LIVE!"The word ripped from my throat—raw, primal, completely divorced from any Academy-approved incantation structure. No geometric weave. No targeting precision. No mana regulation. Just intent, pure and violent, slamming into the room like a fist.The windows shrieked—a high, crystalline scream as pressure differentials tried to tear them from their frames. Cracks spiderwebbed across the glass, jagged fault lines glowing briefly with escaped mana. But the windows held.The monitor yelped a new alarm. But I wasn't done.I pushed harder.The ancient glyphs on my forearms blazed with that unfamiliar color—the Mantravadam color, Nalini's color—and I felt something ancient stir in response. Not the clinical magic of the Academy. Something older. Entropic manipulation. The legacy my mother had hidden in my skin.I tried to freeze the dementia. To grab the corruption by its edges and hold it still, the way she'd taught me in her margin notes. "Find the loophole. Negotiate."But the institutional wards pushed back. The hospital's magical infrastructure, designed to dampen rogue spellwork, smothered my Nair techniques like a wet blanket on a campfire. The entropic manipulation flickered. Failed. Insufficient.The flatline tone drilled into my skull.Something in me snapped.I abandoned all pretense of control. I grabbed the raw, unfiltered mana of my soul and I shoved it into the room, into the walls, into the air, into every surface that would accept the charge. Brute force. Life injection. Feed the universe with so much raw vitality that it chokes on the abundance and forgets to kill.The floor tiles cracked.Vines—thick, green, impossibly fast—erupted from the linoleum, punching through the synthetic flooring like fingers breaking through skin. They spiraled up the IV pole, wrapped around the bed railings, crawled along the walls with a vegetable hunger. Orchids bloomed in the chaos—white, purple, gold—their petals unfurling in seconds before browning and rotting and falling away, a full life cycle compressed into heartbeats.The room became a jungle.I smelled wet earth and chlorophyll and the sickly-sweet rot of accelerated decay. The vines had fed on my power, drunk deep from the well of my desperation—but they hadn't touched the mind. They'd grown around Papa's body, framing him in a grotesque garden, but the dementia was untouched. Unmoved. The corruption wasn't biology. It was data.And I had just demonstrated, in spectacular fashion, that I had no idea how to edit data.The vines settled. The orchids finished their death-spiral. Somewhere in the tangled mess, a bioluminescent mushroom pulsed with a pale, accusatory light."I am not done," I growled at the empty room. The universe. Whatever was listening. My voice cracked and broke, but I pushed the words out anyway. "I'm not—I'm becoming something else. Or nothing at all."The words should have scared me. They didn't.The monitors erupted in a cacophony of warnings.Not the soft blue of institutional calm—the shrieking, pulsing crimson of emergency. Red light flooded the room, bloody and urgent, drowning out the blue glow of normality. The heart-rate graph flatlined. The continuous tone cut through the air like a blade—the high, keening note that meant everything had failed, that the body on the bed had stopped being a patient and started being a corpse.His hand went corpse-cold beneath my grip. The warmth of life drained away like water through sand, evacuating the system that had tethered him to this side of the void.The smell of burnt copper and crushed jasmine returned, suffocatingly thick. The room felt smaller—a claustrophobic contraction of perception, not physics. My vision tunneled. The walls seemed to press in.This was the end. The moment every system had been building toward. The "Transition Event" the documentation euphemized about. The credits roll. The file closes. The resource gets reclaimed.Something ancient stirred in my core. It was a power separate from the exhaustion and grief—a force dormant since birth, now waking to the taste of my desperation and the violence of my refusal.The universe wanted a sacrifice. Fine. I would give it one.But not the one it expected.I opened my mouth. The sound that emerged was a vibration that pre-dated language, bypassing the Old Speech and Academy formulas entirely. It was resonance—a word that existed before categories divided speech from sound, meaning from noise.The room shook.Walls, monitors, air—bending and warping around the sound I was making. The flatline tone cut out, replaced by a thunderous silence. The pause between heartbeats. The void between seconds.My tattoos smoked.Then ignited.Black flames licked along my forearms—actual flames, burning without fuel, consuming nothing but radiating heat that I could feel against my face. A Divinity awoke.Speech had ceased. Replaced by a becoming.For a single, impossible moment, reality bent. The laws that governed everything—physics, magic, probability, causality—all of them flexed and warped around a fixed point that was somehow centered in my chest. I could see his life—the instance of Dinesh Rao, the complex pattern that was a soul—stabilize and strengthen. Pulled back from the brink by a force that had no name in any human language.He gasped.His eyes flickered open—for one second, two, three—and met mine. Not empty. Not the slack gaze of coma. He was there. He was seeing me. His mouth moved, forming a word. Not quite sound, not quite speech—but I could read it on his lips.Bodhi.His hand twitched in my grip. His fingers, impossibly, closed around mine. One squeeze. Weak but intentional. Present.Then the moment passed.His eyes drifted shut. The grip loosened. The monitors blinked back to blue.I collapsed against the bed, forearms smoking, body broken in ways I couldn't even begin to calculate. In my eyes—had anyone been watching—there was a flash of silver and gold. The first glimmer of the Divinity's awakening.The universe had recoiled.And the clock was now ticking on a very different kind of awakening.I didn't decide to break the world. It broke itself.One moment I was staring at Papa's face through tear-blurred vision, watching the monitors flatline, feeling the cold of his hand. The next—Reality dissolved.Not physically. The walls were still there, the vines were still there, the stench of orchids and rot was still there. But overlaid on everything—bleeding through the textures like watermarks on counterfeited currency—was data.Wave functions. Probability clouds. The fundamental mathematics of existence, rendered visible.I could see the bed as a collection of atoms, their quantum states flickering in superposition. I could see the IV pole as a fixed point in spacetime, its mass warping the local geometry in ways my Academy training had only theorized. I could see the gold ring on my finger—Maa's ring—as a cold, dead loop of organized metal, inert and mundane.And I could see him.Papa wasn't a body anymore. He was an equation. A complex, beautiful pattern of consciousness rendered in the language of the Akasha. His soul—the essential Dinesh-ness of him—was a harmonic frequency, a stable waveform that had been playing the same melody for seventy-three years.But there was something wrong with the signal.I saw the dementia: a disharmonic overlay. A set of corrupted frequencies jamming the soul's broadcast, interlaced like garbage data spliced into a pristine recording.And the static was separate from the soul.I could see the gap. The quantum boundary where the corruption ended and the real Dinesh began. It was a contradiction—I shouldn't have been able to see the wave and the particle at the same time, shouldn't have been able to perceive the position and the momentum in the same instant—but I was doing it anyway. I was perceiving the impossible. I was looking at God's source code with debug mode enabled.The old Academy instructors would have called this heresy. The Vatican would have called it blasphemy. Nalini would have called it Mantravadam.I called it a solution.If the dementia was separate from the soul—if it was just a corrupted data layer, a malicious overlay—then maybe I didn't have to cure it. Maybe I just had to delete it.The word rose in my mind like a tide: DISMANTLE.The pressure that had been building in my chest for days—weeks—my entire miserable, clinical life—finally snapped. It wasn't a metaphor. It was a physical shockwave, a tectonic displacement radiating outward from my sternum like a detonation moving through heavy water. The fluorescent tube above Papa’s bed strobed once, twice, a violent, blinding white that cast no shadows. It felt like the room was being overexposed, the reality-engine struggling to render the sheer volume of my intent.A low, subterranean hum crawled into the base of my skull, vibrating through my molars. The air suddenly tasted of dry ice and copper, a sharp, metallic bite that cut through the recycled, antiseptic breath of the hospice ward. Static charge lifted every hair on my arms, my skin prickling with the proximity of a miracle that felt like a crime.I watched the ventilator’s rhythmic hiss falter. The machine’s internal metrics spiked, its LED display flickering into "System Error" as if touched by a literal pulse of divinity. I was standing before I realized I’d even moved, my legs carrying me upright with a weightless purpose that felt borrowed, or perhaps stolen, from something ancient and immovable. My own heartbeat vanished. It didn't slow; it simply ceased to be audible to my own senses, as if the universe had decided my biology was now beneath its notice. I wasn't dead, but I was no longer running on the standard human BIOS.In the darkened monitor, my reflection was a warped, corrupted texture map. A face stared back, but the eyes weren't mine. They were too deep, too focused, too still—like looking into the lens of a high-precision sensor that had just detected a critical flaw in the world.The resonance in my chest wasn't a feeling; it was a frequency. Cold air and burnt jasmine. My vocal cords vibrated without my consent, the sound rising from a place deeper than my lungs.
With Blood-black Ouroborus, the ends begin
A thread of new life,
Reweaving the soul,
And weaving through bone,
And weaving through new skin
Pale mercy stark against the void,
The Fount of Souls plays.
Divinity of Entropy: DISMANTLE
The words didn't just leave my mouth; they launched. Like a bullet leaving a barrel, there was no recall, no undoing the trajectory. The walls of the clinic didn't shatter into debris. They heaved. The beige paint, the scuff marks on the floor, the peeling vinyl of the chair—it all shuddered as if someone were deleting the textures from a simulation in real-time. A shockwave of violet light blasted outward from my chest, passing through Papa’s emaciated body, through the life-support machinery, through the cheap linoleum.Displacement. The sheer thermal output of erasing a sickness that had burned for three years had to go somewhere. The air in the room instantly depressurized, the windows bowing outward with a groan of stressed glass. The plastic casing of the IV pole… it slumped. Melting like wax in a kiln, dripping hot polymers onto the sterile floor.And then, the color died.For five agonizing heartbeats, the room snapped to absolute Greyscale. The "Concept of Color" lagged behind the edit, unable to render the textures fast enough to keep up with the dismantle command. The blood on my lip was black. The light was silver. The world was a charcoal sketch of itself.I wasn't just casting a spell; I was performing a rogue patch on the World’s Memory Management. The dementia wasn't a disease; it was a corruption flag, a data error in the soul’s operating system that had marked my father for accelerated deletion. And I, Bodhisunya Rao, the expelled failure, the apostate, was currently overwriting the source code.A rhythm settled into my bones—slow, heavy, measured. One. Two. Three. It wasn't counting time. It was measuring the distance between this heartbeat and the void. A somatic timer, calibrated in marrow and blood.The realization wasn't triumphant. It was ice-cold. Clinical. I hadn't saved him. I had just paused the delete command. And the universe was already calculating the bill.Behind my head, the Blood-black Ouroboros unfolded.It was as if something that had always existed in the negative space of the room simply chose to render itself visible. The manifestation wasn't a creature, not a symbol, but a glyph—a high-density, three-dimensional sigil suspended in the air behind my skull like a dark halo. It was roughly circular, perhaps a meter in diameter, but the circle was never complete. There was always a gap, a breath, an opening where the recursive loop fed back into itself without ever closing.The glyph was composed of a substance that defied the physics of New Canaan: a fluid so profoundly dark that it didn't just lack light—it erased it. From the corner of my eye, it appeared flat, a two-dimensional wound cut into the hospital’s beige reality. But as I shifted my focus, I perceived the terrifying depth of the thing. The ink-black mass was three-dimensional, its surface rippling with topological variations that rose and fell like a liquid nightmare. Jagged spikes radiated outward from the main body, bleeding into the air like ink dropped into still water. Their edges were a paradox: simultaneously sharp as obsidian and diffuse as smoke.The Ouroboros was not a static object. It was a process. Its substance shifted chaotically between physical states—wisps of gas bleeding from its outer edges, the core flowing like heavy mercury, crystalline spikes freezing and shattering and reforming in the same heartbeat. The phase transitions weren't sequential; they were simultaneous, as if the glyph existed in multiple states of being at once, refusing to commit to any single narrative.And it moved. Not with the smooth rotation of a wheel, but with the stuttering, tilting, yawing motion of a high-complexity script constantly rewriting its own variables. Each new orientation felt like a different command in a language I didn't consciously know but could feel in the marrow of my bones.The sound it made was the soundtrack of structural failure: the groan of a bridge support about to yield, the scream of metal under impossible stress, the crackling static of a data-stream being purged. The air in the room grew heavy, a localized gravity well pulling the falling glass shards from the exploded fluorescent tube into a lazy, spiraling orbit around my head.Faint traceries of gold flickered along the edges of the spikes—visible only when the light hit the Z-axis just right, like the syntax highlighting of a program rendered in a language the universe had deprecated. The voices in my ears weren't random noise; they were data, thousands of nullification commands speaking in a grammar that predated words.I analyzed the Ouroboros with the same clinical detachment I used to read a pathology report. I understood, instantly, that the glyph wasn't a symbol. It was a function.A Recursive Null-Pointer, my mind supplied. A logical loop that reality itself couldn't resolve. The gap in the circle chased itself endlessly because the equation it represented had no solution, no terminus, no escape condition. It was entropy feeding on entropy, decay consuming decay—a perpetual motion machine of negation rendered in three dimensions of ink and hunger.And it was mine.The realization should have cracked my skull. Instead, I felt a cold, detached fascination. I was no longer just a man in a hospice room. I was a Glitch in the Root Code. The Akasha's unhandled exception. The universe's primary delete command.The glyph didn't slow. It accelerated, the gold-traced edges blurring into a continuous ring of flickering syntax that cast a cold, violet-black light. I felt my own body struggling to contain the power, my cells vibrating at a frequency that threatened to dismantle my own physical continuity.The first cost was small: blood trickling from my left nostril—a crimson reminder that divinity wasn't free.The second was not.My molars cracked. I felt them splinter under the pressure of a frequency my skeleton wasn't built to carry, shards of enamel grinding into my gums. My hands seized into white-knuckled claws against the bed rail, a convulsive tremor that wouldn't stop—ten seconds, fifteen—my fingers twitching in patterns I didn't recognize, as if something else was testing the controls.When I looked down at my forearms, the skin had gone translucent. The lattice of veins beneath pulsed with something that wasn't quite blood anymore. Violet threads ran alongside the red, like data-lines in a corrupted circulatory diagram.And my left eye—the one that had alreadt seen too much—ruptured. Not outward. Inward. The sclera flooded crimson, blood pooling where white should have been, even as the right eye remained that terrible, spinning gold-on-black void. I looked like a horror. Half god. Half hemorrhage.The universe was exacting its toll, and my body was the invoice. I was borrowing against a credit line denominated in my own flesh, and the interest was already compounding.I looked at my reflection in the dark monitor beside Papa’s bed. What stared back wasn't me.My eyes had changed. The sclera were absolute black—voids where light was not reflected but deleted from the physical world. My irises had been overwritten with a shimmering, iridescent gold, spinning with the high-complexity "Sub-Routine Data" of the Divinity working within me. I didn't look like a healer anymore.I looked like a monster.
I looked like a god. I looked like a man who had just traded every version of his future for a single, stolen hour of his father’s presence.My face in the reflection was terrifyingly calm, almost beatific, but I felt no peace. My mind was purely "Clinical" now—a scalpel-sharp consciousness, stripped of sentiment, observing the world without judgment. My hands were trembling. I hadn't noticed until I saw them shake in the reflection. The corrupted texture maps of my own skin told me everything I needed to know: I had crossed a threshold that had no return path. I was a system that had overwritten its own recovery partitions.I ran diagnostics on my own soul, and the results were damning. My chest ached with a hollowness that had no source—like hunger, but for something I couldn't name. The Ouroboros was not something I had conjured; it was something I had extracted. It was drawn from a wellspring of negation that had apparently always existed at the core of my identity, a buried command waiting for the right trigger.Every second the glyph spun behind my head, it consumed something. Not mana. Not energy. Not the stuff the Vatican taught us about in their sanitized magic classes. It consumed meaning.The memories themselves remained—crystalline, complete, high-resolution. I could still picture my mother's smile, recall the exact timbre of her laugh as she hummed in the kitchen. I could see the steam rising from the Sunday morning chai, the way Papa would steep the cardamom just a few seconds too long so the tea had a sharp, spicy bite. But the weight of those images was dissolving. The warmth they once carried was being bled away to fuel the spell.It felt like reading the metadata of someone else's life. I remembered the chipped ceramic mug I used to love, but I couldn't remember why I loved it. The Abyss wasn't stealing the data; it was stealing my capacity to care about it. My emotional architecture was being dismantled block by block, processed into the raw, impossible possibilities required to keep Papa’s heart beating. My throat tightened around nothing. I swallowed, and the absence tasted like copper.The math was simple, brutal, and utterly non-negotiable: one hour of lucidity for Papa, in exchange for a lifetime of my own emotional continuity. The trade was already in progress, and I realized with a cold, detached horror that there was no "Cancel" button on this operation. Somewhere deep in my ribcage, I felt a strand snap. One less tether to the person I used to be.I was becoming a void to save a ghost.Papa gasped. The sound wasn't the rattling, shallow breath of a dying man—it was a violent, hydraulic shudder, a gasp like tearing fabric forcing air into lungs that had forgotten the rhythm of breath.His eyes flew open. For the first time in three years, they were clear. The milkiness, the distant confusion, the way he would look at me and see a polite, well-meaning stranger—all of it had been dismantled by a single word of divine negation.Papa sat up in the hospital bed, his emaciated body moving with a sudden, impossible strength. His gaze locked onto mine with the impact of a physical blow—then tracked something behind my shoulder. Something he shouldn't have been able to perceive. But the spell that had woken him had opened more than just his mind. He saw the Ouroboros spinning behind me. He saw the black sclera, the golden, data-spinning irises. He saw what I had become.But he didn't scream. He didn't flinch. He looked at me with a terrifying clarity—the gaze of a father who had finally, finally woken up to say goodbye."Beta."His voice wasn't the papery whisper I’d grown used to in this ward. It was strong, clear, and terrifyingly present—the voice of the engineer who used to explain bridge mathematics to me over breakfast, the man who would stay up until 2:00 AM helping me with calculus, the father who never told me magic was evil, only that it was expensive."Beta, what have you done?"The question wasn't an accusation. It was curious. Tender. It was the tone of a man who has watched his son perform a miracle and is trying to decide whether to be proud or terrified. His hand reached out, skeletal fingers wrapping around my wrist with a grip that was solid. Real.That warmth was the first truly human sensation I’d felt since the Ouroboros unfolded.And with it came the flood—memories crashing through my clinical detachment like a dam collapsing under a spring thaw. Three years. Three years of sitting in this vinyl chair while he looked at me with the polite, empty confusion of a man meeting an acquaintance he’d forgotten at a party. Three years of “Papa, it’s me, it’s Bodhi, your son,” met with blank smiles and gentle questions about who I was looking for.Now those eyes were focused. They were seeing me. Truly seeing me.My chest cracked open. I didn't know what to say. For three straight days, I’d been rehearsing speeches—explanations, apologies, clinical defenses of my decisions—and now that he was here, every prepared word evaporated like dew under a desert sun.There was so much. Too much data to process in the time remaining. Nineteen years of unspoken conversations were stacked up behind my teeth, a logjam of everything I’d been too cowardly or too busy to say. The confession about the clinic—how I’d traded my future for a stranger’s life. The apology for every missed visit during undergrad. The questions about Maa that had died when she did, unanswered. The simple, stupid things: What was your favorite color? Did you ever really regret coming to New Rome? Were you disappointed that I couldn't handle the standard path because I refused to play the game?I had less than an hour to say all of it.I sank to his knees beside the bed, the Ouroboros accelerating behind my head, and pressed my forehead to his hand. The skin was paper-thin, stretched over bones that jutted like the support struts of his bridges, but it was warm. Alive. The somatic rhythm in my marrow marked another stolen beat—steady, patient, inexorable.Fifty-six minutes. Fifty-six minutes to compress nineteen years into a single conversation.The sob that escaped me wasn't dignified or clinical. It was the raw, animal noise of a child who has finally found his father in a crowded, dark warehouse—the primal relief of safety after too long in the void. It tore out of me without permission, dragging tears with it—salt and snot and three years of suppressed grief exploding in a single, ugly sound. "Papa," I whispered, the word a broken thing. A prayer I didn't know I’d been holding in my lungs for three years.His free hand came up, trembling, and rested on the back of my head. The touch was feather-light—he no longer had the biological resources for more—but it carried the weight of every bridge he’d ever built. "I'm here, beta," he said, his voice cracking on the syllables. "I'm right here."For one perfect, terrible moment, we stayed like that—father and son, kneeling in the violet-black glow of a divine glitch, holding each other in the space between heartbeats. The world outside Room 404 ceased to exist. There was only the heat of his hand and the ticking of the clock in my bones."This isn’t free, son."Papa’s voice had shifted. The tenderness was still there, but it was being overwritten by the cold, analytical weight of the engineer—the man who had spent his life building bridges, who calculated load-bearing tolerances to the fourth decimal place, who understood that every structure had a failure point if you pushed it hard enough. He was looking at the Ouroboros as if it were a faulty structural support."I can feel..." He trailed off, jaw working. His eyes tracked the Ouroboros—and for a second, I saw confusion bleed through. He was mapping the glyph like a blueprint, but the scale kept slipping. "...the interest. Mounting." He turned to me, and his focus sharpened with visible effort. "That thing, beta. It's a loan. High-interest." He tapped his temple, the gesture shaky but deliberate. "Engineer's instinct. Can't turn it off. Even now." A bitter smile cracked his lips. "Every second it shifts, you're getting lighter. I can feel you evaporating. From the other end."He coughed—wet, rattling—and the Ouroboros flared gold. His grip on my wrist tightened like a drowning man finding rope. "Don't serve the debt." He was fading, the clarity already starting to short-circuit. "Break the bank, beta. Break it."The words were cryptic—typical of the way he used to teach me—but in this state, I understood them with a clarity that bypassed language. He was telling me to reject the terms of service. To find a loophole in the universe’s logic. To refuse the Divinity’s predatory credit line.I analyzed the situation with the same scalpel consciousness I applied to the spell itself. The "Clock Speed" of this resurrection was too high. The universe was already trying to write Papa back into the void, and the only thing preventing the deletion was the Ouroboros’s recursive loop—a logical contradiction the system couldn't resolve.But the loop required fuel, and that fuel was my own emotional architecture. I could feel the connections being purged in real-time. The memory of my mother’s voice was already flat, a low-fidelity recording. My childhood triumphs were becoming a list of facts I no longer felt proud of.The Divinity wasn't offering a miracle; it was executing a hostile acquisition of my identity. And my father, even now, at the end of his own sequence, was trying to teach me one last lesson: the most dangerous debts are the ones you don't realize you've already signed.The rhythm in my marrow marked another pulse. It was tectonic, a slow, heavy thrum that vibrated through my bones. One. Two. Fifty-four minutes left. I gripped his hand tighter, as if I could physically anchor him to this dimension through sheer force of will, but the warmth was already starting to leak out. His fingers were growing lighter, less substantial, as if the universe was slowly dialing down his presence in preparation for the final garbage collection."I’m proud of you, beta," he said, and the words were a gift I felt myself losing the ability to appreciate even as he spoke them. "But don't trade your soul for borrowed miracles. The math will always find its balance."I looked away from Papa's face, my gaze sweeping the room. I wasn't seeing Room 404 anymore. Not really.The physical world had become a "Low-Fidelity Render." The jungle had gone still—vines frozen mid-crawl along the walls, dead orchids suspended in their decay, the bioluminescent mushrooms pulsing faintly in the shadows. The white vinyl of the privacy curtain, strangled by creepers. The stainless steel IV pole, wrapped in green. It was all vibrating with a subtle, entropic jitter, as if reality were struggling to maintain its resolution in the presence of my Divinity. Where the violet-black light of the Ouroboros touched the surfaces, they didn't just darken; they simplified.The textures were bleeding away, leaving behind the "Wireframe Logic" of the objects. I saw the IV pole not as a metal rod, but as a series of vectors and intersection points, a mathematical proof of its own existence that was being slowly, methodically retracted. I tried to blink the vision away, to see the room as a place where my father lived, not a dataset where he died. But the geometry persisted. Cold. True. Indifferent.This was the true nature of the gift I’d extracted from the void. It wasn't "Abyssal" in the way the poets described it—no rusting iron or rotting wood. It was Conceptual Zero. It was the power to mark a thing for garbage collection. To tell the universe that a specific instance of reality was no longer required."Beta, look at me."I turned back. Papa was watching me, his eyes tracking the way my focus drifted toward the de-rendering corners of the room. He understood. Even with his mind being held together by a glitch, he understood."The shadows," I whispered. My own voice sounded like a recording played back at the wrong speed. "They aren't just lack of light, Papa. They’re... they’re the buffer."I reached out and touched the edge of the privacy curtain. My fingertips didn't meet fabric; they met a cold, vibrating resistance that felt like the hum of a dead server. Beneath my touch, the white vinyl turned grey, then charcoal, then a profound, light-swallowing black that had no texture at all. It was a hole in the world."Everything has a pointer," I said, the words feeling like they were being forced through my throat by a system I didn't control. "Everything is an instance. And I can... I can just delete the reference."I pulled my hand back. A small, circular patch of the curtain remained absolute black—an unrendered null-space where the universe had simply stopped trying to describe "curtain."The clinical detachment in my mind analyzed the phenomenon with terrifying efficiency. It made me sick. I wanted to hold his hand and weep, but my brain was too busy compiling the crash report. I realized that my magic wasn't "Fuck Magic" because it was anti-establishment; it was "Fuck Magic" because it was the ultimate anti-pattern. It was a bypass of the entire Akasha’s grammatical structure. I wasn't playing by the rules of incantations and ingredients. I was just reaching into the source code and deleting lines.The somatic pulse in my marrow thudded. One. Two. Fifty-one minutes left.The smell of the room had changed again—the antiseptic reek and electric burn were gone. It smelled like the vacuum of space. Cold, sterile, and perfectly empty. The sound of the ventilator—already silenced by my first command—was replaced by a low-frequency static, the sound of the universe’s "Garbage Collector" process trying to resolve the conflict I’d created.I was the conflict. I was the unhandled exception."Don't lose the boy to find the god," Papa said, his voice a frail anchor in the rising tide of my negation.I looked at his skeletal hand, still pale and warm against my own, and felt a flicker of the "Weight" I was losing. I wanted to tell him I was sorry. I wanted to tell him I didn't know how to stop. But the "Sorry" felt like a data error, a legacy function that my current architecture could no longer execute.I just watched the shadows eat the edges of the room, and I understood, with a chilling certainty, that the void wasn't something out there in the dark. It was the only thing that was real.The Ouroboros flared, its ink-fluid surface suddenly becoming a screen for my own internal decomposition.I saw them—the "Sacred Data" of my childhood, projected across the phase-shifting Z-axis of the glyph. I saw my mother, Nalini, her face vibrant and warm, laughing as she chased me through a park in New Rome. I saw the sun reflecting off the water in Goa, the taste of salt on my lips. I saw the day I’d finally mastered the logic gates in Papa’s workshop, the look of pure, unadulterated pride on his face.But the images were corrupting.Golden syntax-traceries burned through the memories like white phosphorous through paper. The park in New Rome began to pixelate, the green of the trees bleeding into a dull, neutral grey. The sound of the waves in Goa was swallowed by a low-frequency hum, the same rhythmic vibration that was currently thrumming in my marrow.The universe wasn't just taking the energy; it was taking the Emotional Weight. It was eyeing my most precious anchors and preparing to click Delete.I felt a sharp, pulling sensation in the back of my skull, like a fishhook caught in the meat of my brain. My mind, still functioning with that cursed clinical detachment, analyzed the trade. The algorithm of the world was simple: to keep an expired instance—Papa—active, I had to provide equivalent soul-data to balance the equations. And I had very little data left that was valuable enough to pay for a man’s life.In the dark silence of my internal monologue, I tried to bargain.Take the memory of my first surgery. Take the feeling of the rain in London. Take the pride I felt when I graduated. Just... leave the rest.But the Void doesn't negotiate. It is not a merchant—it is a calculator. And it doesn't take what you offer. It takes what it wants.And what it wanted first wasn't the grief. Wasn't the pain. Wasn't any of the memories I could afford to lose.It took the argument about the dishes.A stupid fight. Papa and I, six months before the diagnosis, shouting over unwashed plates in the sink. He'd accused me of treating the apartment like a hotel. I'd said something cutting about him being lonely and controlling. We hadn't spoken for two weeks. I'd never apologized. I was going to—after my residency finished, after I had time—but then the dementia came, and there was no one left to apologize to.Gone. The guilt of it. The petty shame. The thing I would never get to make right—just erased. Not forgiven. Deleted. The universe had reached into my chest and pulled out the receipt for an unpaid debt, and now the debt no longer existed.But I felt robbed.Why that one? Disbelief choked me. Something else. Anything else. Something that doesn't matter.The universe cannot quantify "quality"—it only counts "magnitude." And to buy an hour of high-fidelity consciousness for a decaying brain, I had to feed it roughly a hundred and twenty hours of my own high-fidelity emotional history.Yield for yield. The first major connection to initiate "Desaturation" was the memory of Maa’s death.I felt it happen—a sudden, hollow absence in the center of my chest where a jagged wound of grief had lived for years. I still remembered the facts. October 14th. The sterile room. The smell of lilies. The way the light hit the hospital floor. But the weight of it was gone. The love, the devastation, the three years of mourning—it was all processed into raw data.It was a fact in a history book. My mother. Dead. I knew who she was, I knew she was gone, but the data meant nothing. I recalled everything except why it mattered to me so much at the time.I looked at Papa, and for a terrifying second, I felt nothing but the clinical curiosity of a scientist observing a patient. The connection that had fueled my walk to this hospice, the desperation that had driven me to overwrite the world—it was all being recycled into the very miracle I was performing.The Ouroboros spun faster, the gold edges blurring into a continuous ring of flickering commands. The cost was mounting, and I was running out of "Liquid Meaning" to pay it.I was saving his life by erasing the reasons I had for doing so."Bodhi?" Papa's voice was sharp. Clear. "Are you listening?"I felt my dad stare into the void I was becoming. And for the first time, the void didn't scare me. It felt... efficient.The Ouroboros flared, hungry for more. Fifty minutes remaining.]]></description><link>manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-08-draft.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Projects/Writing/Books/The Cleric Saga/_bmad-output/manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-08-draft.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 18:05:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[merged_manuscript]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Uttara&nbsp;Edited by:&nbsp;Ananmayu RaoFirst Edition: [Month, Year]Disclaimer
Author’s Note:&nbsp;While this story takes place in fictionalized versions of Newark, New York City, and Rome, certain landmarks, street names, and historical details have been altered for the sake of the narrative. Any supernatural occurrences or magical organizations described herein are purely the product of the author's imagination.

A NOTE FROM THE CLERICBefore you start flipping through this particular chronicle of magical malpractice and bureaucratic nonsense, my legal "representation"--which currently consists of a half-eaten sandwich and a stack of suspension notices--insists I lay down some ground rules.The "It’s All Fake" Clause:&nbsp;This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual persons, living, dead, or currently undergoing a messy "Sub-Resurrection Causal Inversion," is entirely coincidental. If you think a character looks like you, take it as a hint to work on your personality. The names, places, and incidents are products of an imagination currently fueled by adrenaline and spite.The Geography of Grime:&nbsp;While this story takes place in a version of the modern world that looks suspiciously like the North Atlantic Magical Federation (shoutout to the damp, gray glory of Woodbridge, NJ), I’ve moved some landmarks around. If you go looking for a specific alley-clinic to get a bootleg entropy-scrub, don't. I’ve altered the street names to keep the Crimson-armored "phenomenal dunces" from knocking on the wrong doors.The "Don't Be a Statistic" Warning:&nbsp;You’re going to see some Old Speech in here. You’re going to read about rites that displace reality like a quantum middle finger to the Standard Model.&nbsp;Do. Not. Attempt. Them.&nbsp;Seriously. If you try to recite an Aria in your bathtub and end up opening a portal to a dimension made of sentient static and bad vibes, that is on you. I am not responsible for accidental hauntings, localized heat death, or any supernatural entities that decide to squat in your living room without paying rent.Intellectual Property &amp; Rights:&nbsp;Every word, every scar, and every bit of "Some Ol' Bullshit" magic described in this pentalogy belongs to&nbsp;C.M. Roy. He owns the IP, the rights, and the moral high ground (even if the Academy disagrees). If you try to pirate this or reproduce it without permission, I can’t legally hex your Wi-Fi… but I’m a fourth-year Cleric with a lot of free time and a very specific set of skills. Don’t test the White Mage.Now, stop reading the fine print and get to the story. I’ve got a booboos to tend to.-- Bodhisunya "Bodhi" Rao(Unlicensed, Suspended, and Highly Irritated)chapter-01-draftCracked linoleum slits my knees like spite. The kind of petty cut you don't notice until it's stinging through your trousers and the adrenaline backs off. My breath fogs against the kind of winter air that doesn't just invade but squats in corners like it's paying rent. This cheap community "alley"-clinic stinks of half-sterilized bandages, mana-rot, burnt hair, and the quiet panic that lingers when death overstays its welcome. Faintly, the sound of royalty-free "muzak" haunts its way through the air, the Infomercial on the waiting room TV turned up. The girl beneath me convulses again.
"Shh… shh, hey. You’re okay. You’re not—"
Her spine jerks, back arching like a snapped bowstring, mouth frothing in crescents of pink. Her ribs rattle like a bag of old dice under my hands. Blood where there shouldn't be blood, breath where there shouldn't be gaps. Every twitch is a clock tick closer to an obituary. She's losing air, time, and odds—all at once. And me? I'm gambling with Magic.She’s maybe fifteen. Just a kid. Poor thing couldn't even get herself through the door. Pulse in freefall. Every rune-monitor in this slapdash trauma bay screams in a different dialect. A salvaged electrocardiogram kit whines next to a busted cauldron half-full of thaumic coolant. Someone has duct-taped a sanctified camphor talisman to the ceiling. Another has scrawled "LOVE IS A MIRACLE" over it in marker. Yeah? Try billing that to the regulator council.I don't have time to guess how long she's been dying, or how poorly I set this place up, or why the universe keeps leaving corpses at my feet and asking for a receipt. She's here. I'm here. No one else is.I press my palms to her sternum. Cold skin. Too light. The bones feel like they belong to someone who never finished growing.
"ThRun-kel Tuu Vaar'lenna"
No Echo. No Decay.
A pulse kicks from deep in my diaphragm as a Null Field snaps into existence. The air distorts, rippling outward like the heat shimmer on asphalt, then stills. Reality—mundane, lawful, sanitized physics—gets politely evicted. The field blooms. Spherical. Fragile. A dome of anti-reality laced with stolen spells and prayers I barely believe in. The "Old Speech" tends to have that kind of environmental impact, but I'm going for broke here. The standard Med Protocol Statis Field would not be able to handle the severity of her wounds, or the consequences if what I'm about to do is detected.The tattoos etched across my forearms—entropy wards carved in ink and nerve endings—ignite. Pale violet. Huh. That's new. Questions for later.
"Shul'dara Vek Thae-lun"
Burn the end into Birth
I start the incantation. The real one. No Academy-template safezone spells. No healing-lite first-aid authorized by thaumaturgical ethics boards. This is real magic, raw and unlicensed, hates being bent into shape.Each word tears its way up my throat like barbed wire. The null field hums louder, resisting the feed. Magic floods my limbs, burning as it threads itself through my arms. Through scar tissue from doing this sort of thing once-too-often, and spent muscle from just having a day-and-a-half. I force it down, into my wrists, into my fingers.Her wound slowly start shuddering as they stitch themselves together, previously-spilled ichor tracing its way back inside it's host.Not fast enough. Not nearly fast enoughShe's drowning inside herself. Organ failure. Lungs filling. My field tenses. Feedback spirals along my spine. The limiter—every damn student has one, coded into our IDs, our aura signatures, even the cuffs of our coats—snaps back like a whip.I push harder, audibly snarling. Focus. I redirect flow from my shoulders into the small fractures in my hands. The scars glow brighter –faint, ethereal cracks leaking sickly magenta light. My nails crack from the pressure.
"Come on," I mutter. "Come on, breathe."
Another pulse. Runes etched into the null field flare too wide, too sharp. If anyone nearby has a regulator beacon tuned, they’ll feel that. Screw it. I keep going.
"Vaelun"
"Please." Not a spell. A plea.Her alveoli begin to reknit. Capillaries reroute. Blood reverses direction like I'm unwinding her death.Then—a single inhale. Wet, but real.She jerks. Once. Then goes limp.Still.Still.And then—A breath.Holy shit.She's alive.For a single heartbeat, the world holds.And then the null field screams.Every rune-lamp in the alley explodes in sequence. Light. Shatter. Feedback. The regulator beacon embedded in the mana flow pings out like a flare. I’d bet half my tuition credits someone three blocks away just felt that. The spell collapses inward, folding the null field like paper into itself. Entropy backlash punches through my arms, singeing nerve endings raw. The air smells of ozone, blood, and divine sarcasm.Sirens bloom on the horizon. Not the friendly kind.I’m running out of time.
"Nihil sanctus. Resurgo."
The final phrase stings my gums as I seal the spell. I play it safe, ending the Triplet with Latin for stability, even if leaning on mass-production spellwork tastes a bit wrong in my mouth. Internal lattice reweaves. Circulatory rhythm stabilizes. Her color improves.I wrap her in a silver-foil thermal, tucking the edges under her elbows. I reach into my coat, unhook the entropy-seal clasped to my wrist—my tracker, my confession, my crime—and place it beside her fingers.Footsteps thud. Not fast. Intentional. Crimson-armored Regulators appear at the alley mouth in a staggered diamond formation. Wands already drawn. Suppression wards vibrating across their forearms.Eight of them. Full complement. They were expecting worse.
"Hands where we can see them!"
I stay kneeling.I raise my hands.Magic still dances in my bones. My grip on it loosens as I let it go.
"I was just practicing my thesis," I say.
Helmet visors don’t crack smiles. Worth a shot.
"Step away from the girl."
"She’s stable. If you touch her before the field fully fades, she’ll spike and you’ll have killed her."
They don’t care. Two step forward.
"Uh-uh, fellas. Florence Nightingale's got that sweet chin music for you if you touch my patient". Knowing their attention needs to be kept on me, I lean back on my heels and sit myself on my rear, my legs splayed and oh-so-conveniently blocking their path to the teen. The two give a glance at one another, before rejoining the group to form a half-circle. One begins the arrest ritual, voice flat, like I’m just another datapoint.
"Name. Student ID. Magical license class."
I tilt my head. Real slow. Let the silence drag an extra beat. Then I twist my lips into the most exaggerated, cartoonishly unimpressed pout I can muster—upper lip out, nose crinkled, eyelids half-mast like I’ve just smelled bureaucratic rot baking in the sun.
"No." I really let that syllable drag out. Not shouted. Not whispered. Just... stated. Like gravity. Or spite. I swear even their hoods looked shocked.
"You refuse to comply?"
"I'm declining to comply, Chief" I say, the vowels dripping with the sacred indignation of a Looney Tune on his last carrot.
"Subtle difference."
Somewhere in the back of my head, I hear a faint wahh-wahhhh fade in the distance. One of the Hoods with a Golden North Atlantic Magic Federation Insignia emblazoned on his right-arm gauntlet steps forward. I wonder if he can see my smirk behind that visor.A wand muzzle touches my temple. It hums.
Yeah. He saw it.
"Unauthorized miracle-working in a restricted zone."
"Emergency clause."
"No academy supervisor signed off."
That’s it. That’s the moment.chapter-02-draftchapter-03-draftchapter-04-draftchapter-05-draftchapter-06-draftchapter-07-draftchapter-08-draftchapter-09-draftchapter-10-draftchapter-11-draftchapter-12-draftchapter-13-draft]]></description><link>manuscript/merged_manuscript.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Projects/Writing/Books/The Cleric Saga/_bmad-output/manuscript/merged_manuscript.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:30:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[chapter-13-draft]]></title><description><![CDATA[The world did not end with a bang, but with a hollow sound. A sound like a god inhaling the sky, followed by the wet, percussive slap of reality trying to fill the vacuum.Bianco Cavaretta lay face down in the slurry of what used to be the family estate's rose garden. It was a place he knew better than his own reflection. He knew the specific ph of the soil here (acidic, tweaked for the hybrid tea roses). He knew the layout of the trellis work (imported ironwood from the Northern Zone). He knew that if he turned his head three degrees to the left, he would see the marble fountain his grandfather had commissioned to celebrate the family’s ascent to the High Council.Now, there was only ash.The mud was boiling. It pushed against his cheek, hot and viscous, smelling of ozone, burnt sugar, and the coppery, unmistakable tang of atomized blood. It wasn't just mud; it was a soup of destruction, a suspension of everything Bianco had ever called home, ground down to its molecular substrate.He tried to push himself up. His brain sent the command—elevation, urgency, flee—but the signal died somewhere in his spinal cord. His arms were shaking so violently they wouldn't lock. He managed to roll onto his side, the movement agonizing, like grinding broken glass into his hip. He coughed, a wet, rattling sound, and spat out a mouthful of black phlegm that tasted of propellant and death.His bespoke silk suit—a gift for his twenty-first birthday, tailored by the finest weaver in Rome, a garment that cost more than a citizen earned in a decade—was fused to his skin in places. He could feel the ruined fabric pulling at his burns, a constant, stinging reminder of his own fragility.Nonno.The memory hit him harder than the blast wave. It wasn't a vague sense of loss; it was a high-definition assault. He remembered the smell of his father's cologne—sandalwood and expensive tobacco—that had lingered in the library just this morning. He remembered the weight of his father’s hand on his shoulder during the Solstice Gala, the pride in the old man's voice.“Resistance is legacy, Bianco. We do not break. We endure.”And then, the light. The blinding, white-hot silhouette of his uncle standing against the sun, a figure of pure radiant energy. And Papa standing there, defiant, unbreaking.And then... simply ceasing to be.Not dying. Dying implied a process. Dying implied a body, a funeral, a transition. This was deletion. One moment, the patriarch of House Cavaretta was a pillar of the world; the next, he was physics. He was heat. He was a shadow burned into the retina of the universe.Bianco wept. It was a small, pathetic sound in the silence of the crater, a whimper that had no place in the aftermath of such divine violence. He wiped his eyes with a trembling hand, smearing soot and blood across his face, effectively blinding himself with the grime of his own survival.He blinked, trying to clear the grit. He looked toward the epicenter.He expected to see a corpse. He needed to see a corpse. He needed to see the charred, twisted remains of the cousin he had tried to save, the cousin whose instability had birthed this nightmare. He needed Bodhi to be dead. If Bodhi was dead, then this was a tragedy. A terrible, incomprehensible accident.But if Bodhi was alive... then this was a war crime. This was a murder.The smoke cleared, stripped away by the heavy, radioactive rain that had begun to fall.And Bianco saw the Monster.It stood in the exact center of the glassed earth, at the focal point of the deletion event. It was naked, its skin pale and luminous against the charcoal ground, like a shard of moonstone dropped into a coal bin. It wasn't burned. It wasn't bleeding. It was pristine.But it wasn't standing still.It was... vibrating.Bianco squeezed his eyes shut and opened them again, certain he was suffering from a concussion. But the image didn't resolve. The figure—Bodhi—seemed to be skipping frames in reality's render cycle. One second he was facing north, looking at the ruin of the manor house; the next, he was facing south, staring into the dark tree line. There was no transition. No blur of motion. Just Variable A becoming Variable B without passing through the space in between.His limbs moved with a fluid, aquatic grace that defied the physics of gravity. He didn't shift his weight; he simply altered his position relative to the ground.And the noise.It wasn't a hum. It wasn't the wind. It was the sound of a hard drive scratching, amplified to a deafening screech that bypassed the ears and vibrated directly in the jawbone. It was the sound of logic failing. It was the high-pitched whine of reality complaining that something existed within it that was violating its Terms of Service.The rain fell harder, a torrential downpour of cold, acidic water.But it didn't touch him.Bianco watched in horror as the raindrops curved around Bodhi’s form. They didn't bounce off a shield; they simply refused to occupy the same coordinates. The space around Bodhi was a dry zone, a bubble of rejected causality. The water feared him. The air seemed to recoil from his skin, creating a shimmering heat haze that distorted the background."Bodhi?" Bianco whispered. The name felt like a curse on his tongue. It felt like summoning a demon.The figure stopped vibrating. The transition was instant. From 100 mph blurring to absolute statuesque stillness in zero seconds. Inertia was ignored.The head snapped toward him—too fast. Necks shouldn't move that fast. Vertebrae should snap. Muscles should tear.But the Monster just smiled.The eyes were gone. There were no whites, no pupils, no irises. There were just twin pools of spinning gold fractals, infinite geometric loops eating the light around them. They were windows into a furnace, into a place where math burned hot enough to melt souls.Bianco stopped weeping. He forgot how to breathe. He forgot his father. He forgot the estate.In the face of this anomaly, grief was a luxury he could no longer afford. There was only the primal, lizard-brain terror of a prey animal realizing it has locked eyes with the apex predator of a new ecosystem.The Monster took a step. The mud didn't squelch. It didn't yield. The ground seemed to harden to meet his foot, eager to support him.Bianco tried to crawl backward, digging his heels into the sludge, but his body was failing him. The terror was a paralyzing agent.Run, his mind screamed. Run before it deletes you too. But he couldn't move. He could only watch as the thing that wore his cousin's face began to drift toward him, carried by a wind that didn't exist.The Monster smiled.It wasn't a human smile. It was too wide, showing too many teeth. It was a rictus of pure, chemical mania. It looked like the expression of a man who had stared into the heart of a nuclear explosion and found it funny."Little Cavaretta," the Thing said.The voice did not come from its mouth. It came from the air, from the mud, from the buzzing inside Bianco's molars. It sounded like a choir of thousands, all screaming in digital harmony."Little white stallion," the voice distorted, pitching down into a bass that rattled Bianco's ribs. "Did you lose your saddle?"Bianco scrambled backward, his heels digging into the sludge. "Stay back," he whimpered. "Stay back, you... you thing."Bodhi didn't walk. He just... occurred closer.A flicker of black static, and suddenly he was standing five feet away. Another flicker. Two feet.Bianco could see the details now, and he wished he couldn't. Bodhi's skin was translucent, revealing veins that pulsed with black light instead of blood. There were symbols—glowing, golden glyphs—crawling under his epidermis like worms.The Monster smiled.It wasn't a human smile. It was a geometry problem. It was too wide, stretching the skin past the point of elasticity, revealing too many teeth that looked too white, too sharp, too... new. It was a rictus of pure, chemical mania, the expression of a man who had stared into the heart of a nuclear explosion and found the math hilarious."Little Cavaretta," the Thing said.The voice did not come from its mouth. Bianco saw the lips move, but the sound didn't sync. It came from the air, from the mud, from the buzzing inside Bianco's molars. It sounded like a choir of thousands, all screaming in digital harmony, layered over a bass track that felt like an earthquake."Little white stallion," the voice distorted, pitching down into a sub-frequency that rattled Bianco's ribs like a cage. "Did you lose your saddle?"Bianco scrambled backward, his heels digging furrows into the radioactive sludge. "Stay back," he whimpered, his voice cracking like dry wood. "Stay back, you... you thing."Bodhi didn't walk.Walking involved locomotion. Walking involved leverage, friction, the transfer of kinetic energy. Bodhi simply... occurred closer.A flicker of black static—like a corrupted video file—and suddenly he was standing twenty feet away. Another flicker. Ten feet. There was no movement, only a re-writing of coordinates. The air displaced by his sudden arrival cracked like a whip.Cousin Bodhi. The failure. The Null. The boy who couldn't light a candle with magic if his life depended on it. Bianco remembered him tripping over his own robes at the academy. He remembered him stuttering through basic theory exams. Make-fun-of-him Bodhi. Pity-him Bodhi.That boy was gone. Deleted.Bianco could see the details now, and he wished he couldn't. Bodhi's skin was translucent, glowing with an inner, sickly light. Beneath the epidermis, veins pulsed not with red blood, but with black, viscosity-free light. And deeper still, etched into the very muscle fibers, were symbols—glowing, golden glyphs that crawled and shifted like living worms."Monster," Bianco breathed. It was the only categorization his brain could offer.Bodhi tilted his head. The gold fractals in his eyes spun faster, a kaleidoscope of impossible geometry."Monster?" the voice echoed, layering over itself—soprano, alto, bass, static. "That IS a categorization error, cousin. Check the scoreboard. We are the only reason you aren't currently participating in the water cycle as a fine red mist."Use of the plural. We.Bianco felt his bladder loosen. The horror was total. "You killed him. You killed my father. You murdered him.""We deleted an obstacle," Bodhi corrected, his tone bored, clinical. "He was holding onto legacy code. Deprecated software. He tried to upload a firewall when the system was already formatting the drive."He reached out. His hand was wreathed in black sparks that hissed as they touched the oxygen, burning holes in the very air."And you know what happens to legacy code, Bianco?"Bianco shut his eyes, waiting for the end. Waiting to be deleted. He tried to think of a prayer, but the Gods felt very far away, and the Monster was very, very close.A finger touched his nose. Boop.It didn't feel like flesh. It felt like touching a live wire, a localized polarity reversal that sent a jolt of static electricity snapping against Bianco's skin.He yelped, his eyes flying open.Bodhi was leaning in, mere inches away, that terrible, shark-like grin stretching his face to the breaking point. The gold eyes were spinning so fast they were a solid disk of light."Sike," Bodhi whispered.The word hung in the air, heavy and wrong.Then, the world snapped back. The static vanished. The choir of voices cut out, leaving only one: Bodhi’s familiar, mocking tenor.Bodhi pulled back, executing a pirouette that looked like a video game character glitched into a loop, spinning three times before landing in a perfect crouch."I'm just fuckin' with ya, B!" Bodhi crowed, pointing a black-clawed finger at Bianco. "Look at your face! You look like a constipated gargoyle who just realized he’s made of stone!"The laugh that followed was a wet, barking sound. It wasn't the laugh of a sane man. It was the laugh of someone whose sanity had snapped so cleanly it had left no jagged edges to snag on reality.Bianco stared at him, his mind unable to bridge the gap. The cognitive dissonance was physically painful. One moment, he was facing an eldritch horror, a god of entropy. The next, his cousin was making a 'your mom' joke in the middle of a blast crater. The whiplash made him want to vomit."What... what are you?" Bianco whispered, his voice trembling.Bodhi stopped laughing. He stood up, throwing his arms wide. Black lightning arced from his fingertips, scorching the mud, writing equations in the ash that faded before Bianco could read them."Survival!" Bodhi shouted to the storm. "We are the Update! We are the Patch! The regulators are coming, cousin! The devs are trying to roll back the server!"Bianco heard it then. Beneath the rain, beneath the ringing in his ears.The low, rhythmic thrumming in the distance. Engines. Heavy, military-grade turbines displacing air."NAMF," Bianco realized, the name tasting like cold iron. "The drones.""The Fun Police!" Bodhi corrected, grabbing Bianco's arm. His grip was like iron pliers, unyielding and hot. "Time to go! Chop chop! I want to see if I can outrun a missile! I bet I can. I bet I can outrun the concept of 'impact'!"He hauled Bianco to his feet as if he weighed nothing. Bianco stumbled, his legs jelly, his equilibrium shattered."Bodhi, we can't," Bianco sobbed, the hopelessness crashing down on him. "There's nowhere to go. They'll kill us. Look at this... look at what you did. There’s nothing left."Bodhi turned. The gold eyes locked onto him, and for a second, the mania vanished. The laughter died. In its place was a cold, terrifying clarity. The clarity of a machine that had calculated the odds, run the simulation a billion times, and decided that the outcome was irrelevant because the game itself was rigged."They can try," Bodhi said softly. "But I think we're going to find that their permissions... have been revoked."He turned and dragged Bianco toward the smoke of the shipping yards. Toward the killing fields.And Bianco followed, because the monster in front of him was the only thing scarier than the monsters behind.Input flood.That’s the first thing. Not pain. Not fear. Just Data. A tsunami of raw, unfiltered information crashing against the firewall of my consciousness.I’m not seeing the world anymore. I’m seeing the wireframe.The mud isn't mud; it’s a colloidal suspension of silicon dioxide (SiO2), water (H2O), and decomposed organic particulate matter, currently vibrating at a thermal frequency of 45.2°C due to residual radiation.The rain isn't rain; it’s a kinetic bombardment of acidic droplets, each one carrying a specific pH value (4.2) and a velocity vector (9.8 m/s²).It hurts.It’s like staring at the sun without eyelids. It’s like listening to every radio station on earth simultaneously. The "Eye of Ajna"—the new hardware I just forced into my spiritual socket—is running at 100% capacity, and I don't have the drivers to filter the feed. My brain is overheating. I can feel the synapses firing so fast they’re stripping the myelin off my neurons."Bodhi!"A hand grabs my shoulder. Physical contact.
Source: Bianco Cavaretta.
Force: 45 Newtons.
Skin Temperature: 98.6°F.
Heart Rate: 142 BPM (Tachycardic stress response).
Cortisol Levels: Critical.I blink, and for a second, the wireframe overlay glitches out, revealing Bianco's terrified face. He looks like a smudge of oil paint on a pristine digital canvas."We have to move," he screams, his voice cutting through the digital screeching in my head. "The garrison is active! Look!"He points.My eyes track the vector. I don't just look; I Ping.Zoom: 4x. 8x. 16x.
Enhance: Thermal. Night Vision. Mana-Sensitivity.Through the fog, I see them.Not one drone. Twelve.A full hunter-killer squadron. NAMF Sentry-Class v4.0. I read their specs off the manufacturer's plate welded to their chassis, visible even through the rain. General Dynamics / Thaumaturgic Division. Carbon-fiber chassis reinforced with woven mithril filaments. Levitational drive cores hum with a frequency of 440Hz—the note of A, perfectly tuned for murder.Their weapon arms are spun up. Gatling-armatures loaded with 12.7mm depleted uranium rounds, tipped with hollow-point negation runes. Designed to punch through tank armor and magic shields alike.They are sweeping the shipping yard in a grid pattern. Efficient. Deadly. A networked hive-mind of localized violence.A normal person would see monsters. I see... math. I see a physics equation trying to balance itself to zero."Run," Bianco chokes out, pulling at my sleeve. He’s trying to drag me toward the cover of a rusted shipping container. "Bodhi, please!"But I don't move. I can't.My body feels heavy, vibrating with the residual energy of the resurrection. The entropy is pooling in my gut, hot and heavy like molten lead. My bones feel like they're vibrating at a different frequency than my flesh."Bodhi!" Bianco shrieks. "They'll see us!""They already have," I murmur.My peripheral vision catches the red targeting lasers painting the fog. Twelve lines of coherent light, cutting through the steam, all converging on our position.Target Lock initiated.
Threat Assessment: High.
Action: Terminate.I can hear their internal comms. Not with my ears, but with my mind. They're shaking hands.Unit 7 to Unit Leader: Target acquired. Biological matches fugitive profile.
Unit Leader to Squad: Engage. Free fire zone authorized.I grin. My face feels like it’s cracking, wet clay drying in a kiln."Let 'em come, B," I whisper, the mania bubbling up again. "I need to calibrate the sensors. I need to test the new cooling system."The first bullet hits me in the left shoulder.It comes in low, mean, clean—the drone’s muzzle twitching, physics committing.The world snaps into debug.Time keeps its pace; my brain overclocks—threat-response as interface, fear as math.Rain stipples my eyelashes and turns the yard into gray slurry. Ajna tags 1,142 droplets on my left sleeve alone.The round leaves the drone with a clean, brutal cough. Gilding-metal jacket. Rifling signature stamped into it like a thumbprint. The air in front of the nose cone buckles into a faint shimmer, rain getting bullied out of the way. Ajna hands me the number like a label on a specimen jar:2,800 feet per second.I see my shoulder as a coordinate. Angle of entry. The yaw starting to hunt—just enough to tear instead of cut. Pressure builds in the air a split-second before impact, a soft, ugly whump under the drone’s cough. I watch the copper kiss skin and stop being a projectile and start being a problem.Impact detonates inside my joint. Energy blooms through muscle and bone with the kind of certainty physics reserves for car crashes. My deltoid tears open. My clavicle powders. The round exits out the back and takes a jagged bite of scapula with it, carving a fist-sized window straight through me.The force rewrites my posture. My torso lurches, shoulder dragged backward like a hinge ripped off a door.Warm mist erupts into cold rain. It hangs there for half a beat—red, fine, indecent—before the wind smears it into the yard.I smell iron instantly. Fresh. Bright. Too alive.Bianco screams.It’s raw enough to register under the gunfire, a sound that comes from the bottom of him. He sees me die. He hears the end of the only person in front of him who’s still moving.He’s behind me somewhere—two steps, three—boots sucking at mud, breath catching, hands hovering like he can grab a miracle by the collar and yank it back.My body stays quiet. The part of me that yelps and flinches gets shoved aside like a tab I don’t have time to look at.Pain arrives anyway. It hits the back of my throat first, hot and metallic, then climbs into my skull like a nail being hammered in slow.I look down.Meat. Bone splinters. Nerve threads snapped white and fraying. Steam rising off exposed tissue because the rain can’t cool it fast enough.The cavity through my shoulder flashes daylight and wet darkness. I can see my own ribs through the gap if I tilt just right.That should make me gag.My brain flags it as a fault.Critical Failure: Structural Integrity Lost at Sector 7 (Left Shoulder).
Blood Loss: 0.435 liters/second.
Integrity Timer: 2.3 seconds.
Write Access: GRANTED (SUBSTRATE).
Suggested Action: Restore.I focus.Ajna overlays keep stacking—vectors, stress maps, latency warnings. Every warning wants my attention. I give it a thin slice and keep the rest for the problem in front of me.Clerics negotiate. They pray, they plead, they route their will through sanctioned channels and hope the gods feel generous. That’s the Academy’s whole theology: user permissions, approved endpoints, sacred rate limits.I rewrite.I reach into the wound with my mind—past the gore, past the shock—like sliding my fingers into a seam behind the wallpaper. It feels wrong, intimate in the way surgery is intimate. I grab the frayed nerve endings. The bone dust. The torn muscle fibers that still remember their original shape. I pull up the file history of my own body and check the timestamp.0.482 seconds ago.I loop it.CTRL+Z.Black and gold flares off my shoulder, and reality stutters. The frames misalign. For a fraction of a second my arm exists in overlapping versions—intact, ruined, intact—like the world can’t decide which render to commit to.The yard doubles for a blink. The rain repeats in place, then catches up.Then the correction lands.Bone reseats with a wet hydraulic crack that echoes off shipping containers. Muscle braids itself together in tight, fractal geometry that ignores every medical textbook I ever skimmed. Tendons rethread with a neatness that makes the rest of biology look like a prank. Skin seals over.No scar.Just a faint Ouroboros shimmered into the grain of me—spinning once, hot as a star in its last second, then gone.My shoulder rolls like nothing happened.“Bodhi…” Bianco breathes.He’s frozen. Mouth open. Eyes too wide. Watching catastrophe run backward and trying to find the missing frames.His hands shake in the air, undecided between grabbing me and backing away.“It’s just rain, B,” I say.My voice comes out level. Steady. Wrong.The pain is present—white-hot and absolute—driving straight into the base of my skull. I shove it somewhere quiet. I mute it. A screaming alert turned into a blinking icon I can ignore.Underneath that, something else ticks: the cost meter, the invisible stomach-count. My mouth waters like I’m starving.I start walking.“Bodhi, no!” Bianco yells, boots slipping in slush and mud as he scrambles after me. “Get down! You’re insane! You’re going to get yourself erased!”His voice breaks on erased.I don’t duck. I don’t sprint for cover. I step into the open like the yard belongs to me.The drones hover ahead in a loose line, sleek and humming, their weapon arms already spun up. Red optics, flat and patient. Twelve of them, evenly spaced, as if someone arranged death with a ruler.Their optics track, then hitch.They chirp—short, discordant stutters. Confirmation logic eating its own tail.Target Damaged.
Target Intact.Logic Error.They open fire in unison.The sound isn’t one gun. It’s a sheet of synchronized violence, like industrial nailers emptying into steel. Casings tumble and ping off metal somewhere. Mud kicks up in little brown eruptions around my feet.Rounds slam into me hard enough to shove my whole body backward with each impact.Thwack-thwack-thwack-thwack.My stomach opens. Intestine snaps in three places like wet rope. Heat spills out, then cold rain rushes in.Loop. Restore.The tear vanishes mid-drip. Flesh reknits with a cruel calm. My gut lurches as everything returns to its seat.A round punches through my right thigh and breaks the femur with a dry, ugly pop. For a microsecond I feel bone scrape bone.Loop. Restore.The leg straightens itself before my knee finishes buckling. The bruise never gets a chance to bloom.A cluster catches my chest. My left lung collapses with a flat, awful deflation. My heart gets grazed—pericardium shredded. Blood fills the wrong spaces.Loop. Restore. Loop. Restore. Loop. Restore.Each cycle burns like swallowing acid. Each cycle tastes like pennies.My liver turns to mush under one volley and returns under the next. My spine takes a hit that should steal my legs.It doesn’t get to.Loop. Restore.I stumble.The momentum should have pinned me. It should have made me a crater ornament. I drop to one knee, mud splashing up my pants, cold water seeping into fabric.My hands hit the ground and I feel every pebble through the skin, down to the nerve map.The Ouroboros spins.Black-gold jitter halos my outline now, flickering at the edges like corrupted footage. Rain hits me and doesn’t behave right. Droplets hesitate. Trails double-expose. The yard can’t keep a clean picture of me.Bianco makes a strangled sound behind me. He’s trying to run forward. He can’t decide whether he wants to save me or survive me.I plant my hand on a leg that’s already re-fusing and push up.My lung reinflates with a wet, viscous suck that makes my ribs ache. Air forces its way back into blood-wet alveoli. I cough and spit a flattened slug that had lodged in my throat. It hits the mud with a soft, stupid plop.I wipe my mouth with the back of my hand and smear blood across my knuckles like paint.I keep walking.It turns into a stroll. A casual, obscene stroll through a storm of depleted-uranium slugs.Every step is measured. Every step dares them to correct their assumptions.The cost catches up.Not as an idea.As a debt collector.Hunger clamps down so hard it makes my vision tilt. My tongue sticks to my teeth. Heat rolls through me, then vanishes, leaving a hollow chill in its wake. My hands start to tremble between loops—the tremor that means my body’s negotiating against my will.Fat burns off first—fast, clean, gone. Then muscle. The loop rebuilds it. The loop eats it again. My body is chewing on tomorrow to stay upright today.My jaw aches from clenching. My throat tightens like I’m going to vomit, except there’s nothing to give them. My vision grains at the edges with gold-black static. My heart hammers a rhythm that sounds mechanical, wrong-tempo, a misfiring engine refusing to stall.Somewhere inside my chest a part of me whispers: stop.I don’t.I laugh anyway. Blood sprays from my mouth in a bright, wet fan.“Is that all?” I roar at the drones. “Is that all the ammunition you’ve got? I’m still going! Come on! YOU'RE TRYNA COLLECT MY BOUNTY WITH NOTHING BUT A DOLLAR AND A DREAM. Set phasers from STUN to KILL already! SUMMON UP YOUR DEMONS. HIT ME. FIGHT ME...GIVE ME A HUG!!!”The words shake out of me like a seizure.I spread my arms wide.Rounds punch through my palms—clean holes, digital-age stigmata—and the flesh closes before the blood can commit to falling.The pain tries to climb back onto the main thread.I kick it off.The drones vibrate. Cooling fans scream at the top end of hearing. Their optics twitch, micro-correcting, hunting for a weakness that refuses to exist in the version of reality I’m running.Target Hit.
Target Active.
Damage ineffective.
Infinite Loop detected in biological substrate.Recommendation: Re-evaluate logic.
Recommendation: Escalation. Aim for high-value processing centers.They adjust.No more center mass. No more “kill the body.” They aim for the CPU.The shift is visible in their barrels, a tiny tilt upward. A new solve attempt.A round grazes my temple and takes an ear and a chunk of scalp with it. Cold rain hits bare skull. For one heartbeat I feel the night air inside my own head, sharp and intimate.Loop. Restore.A new ear blooms back into place—pink, wet-looking, perfectly formed—before the old one even finishes falling.The regrown skin itches. I scratch it once, absent.Twenty feet.Ten.I can see the hesitation in their tracking. The tiny delays. The sensor-lenses flicking as if they’re blinking.Their code wants a rule that ends me.It can’t find one.They were built to kill men.I step closer, smiling through the blood.“My turn,” I whisper.Then I shout, voice splitting from the strain of too many consecutive rewrites. “Firewall? Cute. I brought a rootkit.”I snap my fingers at the lead drone.Command: Blue Screen.No incantation. No request. Just instruction—jammed straight into the logic that tells it what it is.I feel the command leave me like a thrown knife. Clean. Direct. Mean.The drone freezes mid-hover. Its red eye goes blank, then washes into a dull, flat blue.For a fraction of a second the whole machine looks confused, like it’s trying to remember its own name.It drops.CRASH.Metal meets mud. Gravity remembers it exists.Eleven left.Bianco’s breath catches hard behind me, a sound like he’s swallowing his own heart.My grin widens until it hurts. The Ouroboros on my shoulder burns hot under my skin.The air bites like I licked a nine-volt battery.“Next!” I scream, and the sound glitches in the rain.We hit the center of the yard. I’m panting, shivering. My body temperature is spiking to 106 degrees. The regeneration is generating too much waste heat. I’m cooking myself from the inside out. Steam is rising from my skin, smelling of copper and burnt hair.The drones are backing up. They have realized that kinetic weaponry is ineffective against a target that treats causality as a suggestion.But they aren't retreating. They're grouping."Bodhi!" Bianco screams from behind a crate. He’s huddled in the fetal position, his hands over his ears. "They're charging! Look at the chests! They're charging up!"I look up.The eleven remaining drones have formed a phalanx. A perfect firing line. Their chest cavities open with a synchronized clack-hiss of hydraulics. Blue light gathers in their cores, a rising whine that sets my teeth on edge.Plasma.My smile falters.Bullets I can loop. Bullets are small. They displace matter, but they don't destroy it. But plasma? Thermal energy concentrated to the point of star-fire? That doesn't leave anything to restore. It vaporizes the hardware. It ionizes the biological substrate. You can't run a System Restore if the hard drive is melted slag."Okay," I mutter, wiping a new stream of blood from my nose. "That’s a problem."I check my mana reserves. Empty. The gauge is flashing red. I spent it all on the light show, on the fear tactics.I check my stamina. Negative. I’m running on fumes and spite. My glycogen stores are depleted. My muscles are eating themselves.I look at the drones. The blue light is blinding now, casting long, sharp shadows through the rain. Charge at 90%.I can't shield this. A standard Cleric Shield would shatter in a microsecond.I can't heal through this. Even with the Ouroboros, I can't out-regenerate total atomization.I have to BEAT it.I look around. The yard is full of shipping containers. Iron. Steel. Carbon. Mountains of mass.Matter.My physics textbook from the Academy flashes in my mind. Chapter 4: Equivalent Exchange. Professor Aris explaining the relationship between matter and energy.E = mc².Energy equals Mass times the Speed of Light squared.It’s the most famous equation in history, but nobody really gets it. They think it's about bombs. It’s not about bombs. It’s about Identity.It means that Mass is just Energy that has slowed down. It means that Energy is just Mass that has decided to go for a run.Which means... they are the same thing.If I can just... flip the bit.I stare at the nearest container. It’s a standard twenty-foot TEU, painted a flaking russet red. Iron oxide. Fe2O3.I focus my Eye. I don't look at the box. I look into it.Zoom: x1000. I see the crystal lattice of the steel.
Zoom: x1,000,000. I see the molecular bonds, the electromagnetic forces holding the atoms together.
Zoom: x1,000,000,000.I see the atoms.They look like solar systems. A dense nucleus of protons and neutrons, orbited by a cloud of probability where the electrons live.I find a single atom of Iron-56. Fate. Randomness. It doesn't matter. It’s the one.Isolate.The universe falls away. The rain stops. The drones stop. The only thing that exists is me and this atom.I focus everything I have left—every scrap of mana, every shredded neuron, every drop of willpower—on the sub-atomic particles inside that nucleus.I don't want to destroy it. I want to invert it.I see the Protons (Positive). I see the Electrons (Negative).I assert Admin Privilege.Command: Invert Polarity.
Target: 1 milligram of Iron.
Action: Spin Reversal.My brain screams. It feels like I’m trying to lift a mountain with my eyelids. The laws of physics are heavy. They don't want to bend. They have been written this way for fourteen billion years.But I am not a physicist. I am a Cleric. I am a Heretic. I am the Glitch.I force the spin to flip.Property: Matter --&gt; Antimatter.For a nanosecond, I hold a tiny speck of anti-iron in the middle of a universe of matter."This is how the World begins anew, B," I whisper. "Not with a whimper. But with a bang."I snap my fingers.
"Divinity of Entropy: Song of the Tyrant Sun"
For a fraction of a second, the universe flinches. The light is sucked into the reaction point. Sound is deleted. The rain hovering in the air evaporates into elementary particles.Then, the annihilation event occurs.The world doesn't turn white.It turns Null.Matter meets Antimatter. They cancel each other out. And in their death, they release 100% of their mass energy.E = mc².It’s not an explosion. It’s a correction.The shockwave moves faster than sound. It moves faster than thought.I see the shipping container—thirty tons of steel—simply cease to be solid. It unspools. The atoms lose their grip on each other. The binding energy that held them together is released in a catastrophic, joyful shout.Then the heat hits.It’s not a wave. It’s a wall. A solid, physical wall of pure thermal expansion.I have 0.0001 seconds to react.Execute: Cleric_Shield_v9.0
Error: Insufficient Mana.Execute: Recusive Regen Loop: Divert_BioMass_to_Epidermis.
Warning: This will result in 90% dermal liquefaction and massive internal trauma.I grin as my face begins to melt.Do it.The blast wave slams into us. I tackle Bianco, driving him into the mud behind the engine block of a rusted forklift. It’s tiny cover, pathetic cover, but it’s mass.I wrap my body around his, creating a cocoon of flesh and bone. I become the shield.I feel my back vaporize.It’s not pain. It’s too fast for pain. It’s just... loss. I feel my skin strip away in layers. The epidermis goes first, turning to carbon dust. Then the dermis. Then the muscle.I feel my ribs turn to charcoal. I feel the water in my blood flash-boil into steam, inflating my veins until they burst.The shockwave hits my spine and I feel the vertebrae crack, grinding together like mortar and pestle.And the noise.
It wasn't a boom. It wasn't a roar.It was the sound of a god inhaling. It was the sound of reality screaming as a hole was punched through its chest. A high, thin, impossible shriek that shattered glass ten miles away.Bianco scrambles into the pilot’s seat. His hands are shaking so bad he can barely find the ignition sequence. He keeps missing the biometric reader, his thumb sliding off the glass panel in a smear of oil and sweat."Start it up, B!" I yell from the co-pilot’s chair, spinning around in it like a child in a candy store. "Spin the wheel! Pull the lever! Do the thing! The popsicle stand is blow, the candle is lit! LET'SA F***ING GOOOOOOOOOOOOO-""I’m TRYING, jackass!" he screams, jamming his thumb onto the reader with enough force to crack the screen. "It's cold! The reactor is cold!"The engine coughs. It wheezes. It sounds like a smoker with bronchitis trying to run a marathon. The dampeners whine, protesting the sudden demand for power. But then—catch. A roar of combustion. Black smoke billows out the back, instantly swallowed by the storm."Yes!" I cheer, punching the dashboard. "She lives! She breathes! She pollutes!"We lurch into the air just as the yard’s main alarm goes off. A siren wails—high-pitched, frantic, a mechanical scream that cuts through the silence I just created. Spotlights sweep the fog, hunting for the source of the devastation."We have company!" Bianco yells, wrestling the yoke as the skimmer fights the crosswinds. "Sensors are lighting up!"I look at the rear monitor. The visuals are grainy, distorted by the radiation interference, but unnecessary. I can feel them.Three NAMF interceptors are rising from the garrison loop. Fast. Sleek. They look like sharks made of matte-black hate. Their engines burn with pure blue mana-fire."They're locking on!" Bianco cries, his voice jumping an octave. "I can see the radar paint! They have tone!"I lean back, putting my feet up on the dashboard, crossing my ankles. "Relax. I got this.""You got this? You're half-dead! You don't have enough mana to light a cigarette!""True," I admit. "But I don't need mana. I just need... access."I close my eyes.I don't visualize the sky. I don't visualize the interceptors. I visualize the network.Everything is connected. The radar waves bouncing off our hull are just data packets. The targeting computers in the interceptors are just logic gates processing variables.Variable: Target_Acquired = True.
Variable: Target_Location = [Latitude, Longitude, Altitude].I reach out. My mind feels slippery, frictionless. I slide past the encryption keys. I ignore the firewalls. They are looking for magic intrusion; they aren't looking for a syntax error.I find the data stream connecting the radar dish to the cockpit display.Edit Property: Opacity.
Edit Property: Radar_Cross_Section.Set Value: NULL.I push the command out. It drains me—a sudden, sharp headache that feels like an icepick to the frontal lobe—but the result is instantaneous.On the monitor, the interceptors veer off. They bank hard left, breaking formation. They’re confused. Their sensors are telling them that the target they were just locking onto has ceased to exist. To them, we are no longer a physical object. We are a ghost. A glitch in the skybox."Where did they go?" Bianco asks, banking the skimmer hard to the right, following the coastline. "Why did they turn?""They didn't go anywhere," I grin, opening one eye. The gold iris spins lazily, tracking the interceptors as they vanish into the clouds. "We just... adjusted our render distance. To them, we're just a skipped frame."I laugh, a high, thin sound that barely covers the ringing in my ears. I’m pushing the hardware too hard. I know it. My brain feels like it’s vibrating in a bath of acid. But God, the speed. The absolute control.For the first time in my life, the world doesn't feel like a cage. It feels like a terminal. And I have the keyboard.We’re over the Atlantic now. The ocean is a black void beneath us, endless and indifferent. The storm has broken, leaving behind a sky full of cold, distant stars that look down on us with zero empathy.Bianco has leveled us out at thirty thousand feet, but he’s white-knuckling the yoke like he’s trying to strangle it. The skimmer groans in the jet stream, trembling like a frightened animal."This is crazy," he mutters, his eyes fixed on the horizon. "This is absolutely crazy. We just... we just erased a shipping yard. We erased a Sentry Squad.""It’s aerodynamic!" I correct him. "Usually."I’m sitting on the floor of the cargo hold now, cross-legged. I’m vibrating. My leg is bouncing up and down at a frequency that is probably annoying, but I can't stop. The energy is trapped under my skin. The Ouroboros on my shoulder is humming, a quiet background process keeping my arm attached to my torso."Bodhi," Bianco says, his voice tight. He doesn't look back. "Are you... okay?""Okay?" I look at him. "Define okay. Am I functioning? Yes. Am I currently metabolizing adrenaline at a rate that would kill a horse? Also yes. Is my soul technically a piece of malware? Debateable.""You... you're smiling," he says. The accusation hangs in the air. "We just lost everything. Your father is... gone. The estate is gone. Everything we knew is ash. And you're smiling."I stop bouncing. The silence stretches, thin and taut, filled only by the drone of the engines."I'm not smiling because I'm happy, B," I say, my voice dropping that octave again. The mania bleeds away, leaving something colder, harder. "I'm smiling because if I stop, I have to acknowledge the fact that I'm currently running on a system that has had its emotional core excised with a rusty spoon."I tap my chest, right over the spot where my heart is beating a frantic, arrhythmic tattoo against my healed ribs."I deleted the panic, Bianco. I looked at the fear—the paralyzing, screaming, animal terror of what we just did—and I dragged it to the Recycle Bin. Because if I feel it? If I actually let myself feel the statistical probability of our survival? If I let myself feel the weight of Papa's death?"I lean forward, the grin returning, sharp and brittle as broken glass."I’d crash this ship into the water just to make the noise stop."Bianco stares at me in the reflection of the cockpit glass. He looks horrified. Good. Horror is a valid output. It means he’s processing the data correctly. He understands the stakes."So," I clap my hands, the sound echoing in the empty hold. "Let’s focus on the mission! Rome! Pizza! Sanctuary! I am the CPU, you are the Driver. Keep eyes on the road, and I’ll keep reality from collapsing around us. Deal?"Bianco swallows. He nods slowly. "Deal.""Excellent!" I flop back onto the deck plating, staring up at the rivets in the ceiling. "Now, wake me up when we hit the Eurozone. I need to defrag my hard drive. I think I have a memory leak in my amygdala."I don't sleep. Sleep is for people who need to knit their subconscious back together. Sleep is for people who have dreams. I don't have dreams anymore; I have simulations.I just stare at the ceiling rivets. I count them. 1,402 rivets. Rivets 45 through 92 show signs of oxidative stress.I look at the ring on my finger.Papa’s ring. Obsidian. Cold. It absorbs the ambient light of the cockpit, a tiny black hole on my hand.I spin it with my thumb. Over and over. A fidget loop.I think about the Source Code.The souls—the 1000 nodes I touched in the Shard—they weren't just data. They were files. Complex, encrypted, beautiful files. And if a file can be deleted... it can be restored.I don't need a resurrection spell. Resurrection is messy. It’s necromancy. It’s guessing. It's trying to paint a portrait from memory.I need a System Restore.I need to find the backup.I hold the ring up to the faint light of the dashboard. The gold in my eyes reflects off the black stone, creating a tiny, inverted universe in the gem's surface."I’m going to find the server," I whisper to the ring. "I’m going to find the admin console for this whole stupid, broken reality. And when I do..."I clench my fist, feeling the metal bite into my skin."...I’m going to fix the bug."It’s not a prayer. Prayers are requests. This is a notification. A patch note.I close my eyes and let the hum of the engine vibrate through my bones. I am a weapon now. I am a tool. And tools have a purpose.Object: World.
Status: Broken.
Action: Repair.Dawn breaks over the Mediterranean. The light is sickly, filtered through the smog of the Industrial Zones, turning the clouds a bruised purple.But then—Rome.It hangs in the sky like a chandelier made of gothic stone and neon.The Holy Roman Empire. The Eternal City. Floating a kilometer above the earth, tethered by crackling ley-lines that hum with raw mana. It is a jewel of impossible architecture, spires of white marble piercing the smog layer, bathed in perpetual, artificial sunlight.I stand up and press my face to the cockpit glass, leaving a greasy smear."Whoa," Bianco breathes. "The Golden Cage."I look at it. My Ajna flares, overlaying the view with data.I don't see the beauty. I see the cost.I see the flow of power—thick, pulsing arteries of mana being sucked up from the earth below. I see the structural stress points on the suspension cables. I see the defensive wards shimmering like heat haze, a complex lattice of 'Keep Out' signals.And I see the shadow it casts. The miles of slums underneath, living in the permanent eclipse of the city above.It’s massive. It’s arrogant. It’s a city built on the backs of the 25 million souls they harvested to fuel this "Paradise." It is a monument to efficient predation.But I don't feel awe. I feel... hunger."It’s not a cage, B," I say, and my voice is steady. The mania has cooled into a cold, hard focus. "It’s a target."I trace the outline of the Vatican on the glass. The Great Dome. The seat of the High Council."That’s where the server is," I say. "The Vault. The Philosopher's Stone. The Root Directory."I look at Bianco. The fear is still there in his eyes, but there’s something else now. Hope? Or just the desperate realization that he’s strapped into a rollercoaster that has no brakes.When I take over the world, this will be the first place I come back to."Take us in," I command.We descend toward the Ludus Magnus boundary. The traffic is thick—luxury skimmers, cargo haulers, military patrols. We slip into the stream, just another piece of debris in the river of commerce.I watch the advertisements flashing on the holographic billboards that line the approach vector.MANA-MAX SUPPLEMENTS!

Sentry Drones: Keeping You Safe. Keeping You Pure.It’s a system. A marketplace. A corrupt, bloated operating system that thinks it’s invincible because no one has ever tried to access the kernel.I flex my fingers. Black sparks dance between my knuckles. The Ouroboros tattoo on my shoulder burns with a cold, comforting heat."They think they’re safe," I murmur. "They think they wrote the code."I turn to Bianco. The gold in my eyes is pulsing a steady, rhythmic beat. A countdown."When we land, we don't just survive," I say. "We log in. We learn their syntax. We find their exploits."I grin. It’s not the manic, terrifying grin of the crater. It’s the sharp, predatory smile of a hacker who just found the password taped to the monitor."And then... we crash the server."Chapter 13 - END]]></description><link>manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-13-draft.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Projects/Writing/Books/The Cleric Saga/_bmad-output/manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-13-draft.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:17:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[chapter-12-draft]]></title><description><![CDATA[The crash is immediate and absolute. I don't fall into the Shard—I'm detonated by it.A million images per second claw through my optic nerve with the violence of a physical assault. Each one is a full-body experience I have no consent to endure. A birthing room. I feel the mother's labor—the wrenching, rhythmic push that splits her pelvis. I am her and not-her, experiencing the wet, primal violence of delivery. The baby crowns. I scream with a throat that isn't mine, the taste of rust and sweat heavy on a tongue I can't control. An alley. The cold bite of a knife slides between ribs that occupy the same conceptual space as mine. The serrated edge catches on cartilage, a grinding vibration that travels up a spine I don't possess. I taste copper flooding a mouth that is suddenly filled with blood. My knees buckle, hitting wet pavement that smells of urine and old rain. A kiss. Soft lips press against mine—or what used to be mine. The phantom taste of chapstick, cherry-flavored and waxy, from a mouth that turned to dust decades before I was born. I feel the flutter of a pulse against my fingertips, the specific, fragile rhythm of a heart in love.A kaleidoscope of death scenes spins across my vision—faces contorting in the final, ugly honesty of agony. Wedding veils dissolve into funeral shrouds in a strobe-light flicker. The rhythmic flicker of hospital lights over gurneys never stops moving, a strobe effect that burns afterimages into retinas that are rapidly failing to process the input.The cacophony of last words is an incoherent roar in my ears. A mother whispering a child's name overlaps with a soldier’s dying curse and a lover’s desperate, bargained plea. It’s a data-flood I was never meant to channel. Smell collides next: the iron tang of arterial spray, the smoke of cities burning, the cloying scent of cheap perfume masked by sweat, and the rot of the inevitable.The mind-break racks my consciousness with relentless efficiency. I try to scream. My throat convulses, searching for vocal cords that don't exist. There's only the sensation of pressure building behind a face I can't feel. My sense of self erodes like sandstone in a hurricane. The version of me that once triaged alleyway casualties is now nothing more than a leaking container for a thousand endings. The trauma isn't something I watch; it's something I am. A sequence of recursive deaths webbing across my sense of self until the porcelain of my ego begins to crack.Subjective time dissolves into a series of flickering snapshots, none of them my own.I live a lifetime as a rice farmer. The ache in my lower back is rhythmic, metronomic, the percussion section of sixty years bent over emerald-green paddies. My hands—calloused, leathered, mapped with scars I don't remember getting—know the weight of rice stalks before my brain does. The monsoon drums overhead, a relentless white noise that seeps into my bones. Mud squelches between my toes, warm and alive and teeming. I know the taste of harvest-season rice, just-cooked, still steaming. I know the brittle, dry-mouthed grief of a failed harvest, years of labor condensed into a single, agonizing breath where the math of survival doesn't add up.Then the channel flicks. Static bites at the edges of my perception.I’m a corporate drone in a city that didn't exist when I was born. My fingers tap on ghost-keyboards, a staccato rhythm that matches the anxious flutter in a chest tight with caffeine and deadline stress. My eyes scan spreadsheets bathed in the sickly, buzzing light of office fluorescents—a frequency that drills a headache right behind my eyes. I understand the syntax of foreign thoughts now. Mandarin. Swahili. Urdu. They overlay my own inner monologue until my internal voice is a crowded room of shouting strangers.The scents are a chaotic assault: the damp sweetness of wet earth and incense clashing with the industrial bite of toner ink and the cloying rot of fish in a sun-baked market. I taste stale coffee on a tongue that isn't mine, the warmth of mother's milk in a body that is once again small and feverish, and the iron of blood from a cheek bitten in a moment of panic I didn't author.I live through the slow, agonizing decline of a dying child. The fever is a fire under my skin. I reach for a mother who never arrives, the small hand growing cold in the white void of the manifest.My sense of 'Self' is butter spread over far too much bread, thinning until the boundaries of Bodhi Rao are nothing more than a suggestion. I forget New Canaan. I forget the hospice room. I forget the smell of antiseptic. I’m becoming an archipelago of borrowed selves, my singular point of awareness dissolving into a vast, collective ocean of trauma.Amidst the screaming data-stream, a single file remains unparsed. Stubbornly corrupted. Protected.'Papa.'The name blinks in the conceptual white-out with the intensity of a lighthouse in a gale. It’s written in a font I recognize—my own handwriting, messy and hurried.In that same heartbeat, the ring on my conceptual finger flares.It burns with a tearing, physical heat. A branding iron of reality. It forces my identity back into a singular point, stapling the scattered pages of my soul back together. I gasp metaphysically—a soundless heave of lungs I no longer possess—and claw myself out of the collective hive mind with fingertips made of pure, raw desperation.The chaos recedes. The roar of a thousand strangers’ lives is muffled by the sudden, rhythmic thrum of a single, distant heartbeat.The scent hits me like a slap.Old Spice.Papa’s scent. Sharp. Spicy. Achingly familiar. It cuts through the cloying rot and the expensive perfumes of the Shard's other victims. It’s a sensory scalpel, slicing away the borrowed memories until only my own remain.I remember the specific scuff on the shoes Papa wore to my wedding—the left toe, worn down from how he pivoted when he worked. I remember the hesitant, proud smile he gave me when I’d mastered my first complex healing sigil, the way the corners of his eyes crinkled.This is the one grief that is his. That is mine. Not a shared file, not a collective trauma, but a personal, jagged wound that fits only the shape of my heart.I cling to it like a life raft in a churning sea. The ring pulses against my spirit, a hot coal that anchors me to the name Bodhi Rao. I have one tether left in this void, and I will let it burn me to the bone before I let it go.The medical part of my mind reboots with the cold, mechanical click of a system coming back online.This is the part of me that fixes things. The part that dissected cadavers in freezing basements, seeing mechanics instead of humanity. The part that diagnosed mana-burn in back alleys by the smell of ozone alone. The part that performed forbidden Causal Inversions when the hospitals turned the poor away.I look at the swirling storm of souls. I don't see tragedy anymore. I see data. I view it with the same clinical detachment I once reserved for terminally ill patients in the NCMA wards—assess, diagnose, treat.The chaotic roar of lives coalesces into data I can interpret. I diagnose the phenomenon instantly: System Congestion. Unresolved Trauma Loops. Corrupted Exit Protocols. This isn't just a storm; it’s a malfunction on a sub-atomic scale.I see the souls now as glitching wireframes. Fragmented holograms of trauma repeating on infinite loops. A child’s cry layered over a gunshot, which bleeds into the flatline of a monitor. The sounds don't just overlap; they stack, building a white noise of perpetual agony. They are polygonal tragedies, low-resolution renderings of high-definition pain.In my mind, the air suddenly smells of sterile hospital corridors and industrial-grade disinfectant. It’s a grounding sensory memory, a tether to my training. I taste cold, clean water—a sharp contrast to the silt of foreign experience I’ve been swallowing.The Shard isn't a battery, I realize. It’s a prison.These souls aren't fuel—they're inmates, freshly processed and permanently stalled. I count them precisely. 1000 local nodes. Each one a human life trapped in its own final, broken moment.The clinical clarity is my greatest weapon. It gives me the distance I need to find the one thing every prisoner dreams of.An exit.I scan the architecture of the void with the precision of a surveyor mapping a crime scene.I run my conceptual hands along the white walls, looking for a seam, a crack, a back door. Anything that suggests the manifold has an edge.There is none.The white walls are infinite. A perfect geometric prison designed by alchemists who understood that the most effective way to trap a soul was to remove all points of reference.I try to calculate trajectories for escape. My mind runs probability curves and conceptual thresholds in a rapid-fire sequence. I visualize vectors of force, angles of incidence. Each simulation collapses. Every path I project ends in a recursive loop that leads me right back to the center of my own awareness. Arrows of intent shatter against the curvature of this space.The hum of the machine is omnipresent now. A low-frequency thrum that vibrates through my conceptual bones and rattles teeth I no longer have.The absence of scent is itself a sensory assault. It's a sterile void that mocks my attempt to ground myself. I taste the bitter, metallic aftertaste of failure as one calculation after another hits a dead end.Then, the realization strikes me with the force of a physical blow.I'm too Heavy.My soul-mass, weighted down by the density of my attachments, my memories, and the sheer gravity of my own identity, is what pins me to this white silence. To ascend, to escape the Shard's gravitational pull, I have to become weightless.The obsidian ring on my finger feels like a leaden anvil. A precious weight that is keeping me from the horizon.The calculus is brutal: the more I am, the less I can leave.I look at the memory.It's not a static image. It's a living, breathing moment stored in the core of my sequence—the root directory, the file that defines home. The kitchen in Queens. Our kitchen. Cramped, barely eight feet by ten, with linoleum tiles that had seen better decades. One of them, third from the stove, had a crack shaped like a lightning bolt. I used to trace it with my toe during breakfast.The morning light comes through the window at a forty-five-degree angle, catching the steam rising from two chipped ceramic mugs on the counter. The mugs are mismatched—one pale blue with a faded rooster, one cream-colored with a chip on the rim where I'd dropped it as a kid. The porcelain is warm in my small hands, almost too hot to hold, but I don't let go.Papa is standing by the stove. He stayed home from the shop that day. Just to be with me. The memory of why is corrupted, lost to time, but the fact of his presence is diamond-hard.He's humming. An off-key raga I don't know the name of—something his mother used to sing, maybe, or something he made up on the spot. The melody wobbles, missing notes, but it sounds like safety.The kettle whistles. Not a scream, but a rising, insistent tone—E-flat, if I had to guess. The sound of water reaching the edge of transformation.Papa lifts the kettle with one hand, pours the boiling water into the mugs with the ease of a man who's done this ten thousand times. The steam rises in twin columns, dancing in the morning light like miniature stars.Then the clink. The sharp, metallic percussion of a spoon mixing sugar. He stirs three times clockwise, then taps the rim twice. A ritual. His ritual.The scent arrives last, the way scent always does in memory—complex, layered, overwhelming.Cardamom, sharp and almost astringent, the green pods cracked open in the pot.Ginger, earthy and warm, the kind that burns the back of your throat if you breathe it in too fast.Boiled milk, sweet and comforting, coating the spices with softness.And underneath it all, cutting through everything—Old Spice. Papa's aftershave. The smell of his collar when he hugged me. The smell of him.This is the seed. The core file. The definition of what I used to call love.And to escape the Shard, I don't just have to leave this memory.I have to un-feel it.I have to sever the emotional pointer that makes this moment precious. I have to take Papa—this man standing at the stove, humming his off-key song, pouring chai with calloused hands—and turn him into just another stranger. Another ghost in the static.The ring on my finger feels like a leaden anvil.I feel the weight of Papa's hand on my shoulder—phantom pressure, the memory of safety. It's keeping me here. Pinning me to this void with the gravity of love.The calculus is brutal: I can keep this warmth and drown, or I can cut it out and ascend.I look at Papa's back. The steam rising from the chai. The morning light making the dust dance.And I raise the scalpel.I act.There's no hesitation left. Only the cold, hard certainty of a man who's already calculated the loss and decided the math is worth it.I visualize the Ego—not as the self, but as a tumor. Benign, perhaps. Precious, maybe. But nonetheless killing the patient.I raise the blade of my will. It's been honed by a hundred desperate procedures in a hundred dark alleys. By every time I chose to cut instead of comfort, to excise instead of preserve.And I cut.The words don't need to be spoken aloud. They echo in the void anyway, ratified by something older than magic, colder than physics.I trade my ability to feel this love for the physics to escape it.It's a Binding Vow. Absolute. Irreversible. The universe hears it and says: Accepted.I watch as the memory of my father begins to desaturate.It starts at the edges. The kitchen walls lose their cream color first, fading to a dull beige, then to gray. The cracked tile turns monochrome. The linoleum loses its mustard-yellow tint.Then the steam. The dancing motes of light flatten into grayscale fog.The chai itself—the deep amber of the liquid—drains away like blood from a wound, leaving only a flat, textureless gray.Papa's face is next.The warmth leeches out frame by frame. The brown of his skin becomes a neutral gray. The depth in his eyes—the way they crinkled when he smiled—flattens into a geometric arrangement of pixels.The smile that used to mean safety becomes just a configuration of facial muscles. Data points. Coordinates on a face that could belong to anyone.The laugh—the off-key humming that used to make me feel like the world had an order—flattens into a digital audio sample. Stripped of resonance. Just sound waves playing in a vacuum.The scent of Old Spice vanishes.One moment it's there, sharp and familiar, cutting through the rot and chaos of the Shard.The next, there's nothing. Not even the memory of the scent. Just the sterile void of the manifold.I taste numbness spreading across my tongue. A void where the salt of tears used to live.I feel a sudden, terrifying lightness in my chest. As if my heart has evaporated and left a vacuum in the center of my ribcage.The warmth is gone.The ache is gone.I remember that my father exists. I remember his name. I remember the fact of loving him.But I can no longer feel it.I am hollow.The weight is gone.The instant I sever the emotional pointer, the universe seems to exhale. The gravitational pull of my identity, the dense soul-mass that had anchored me to this prison, dissolves like sugar in hot water.I'm suddenly 'Aerodynamic' to the flow of the void. The souls that had been tearing at my ego moments ago now slide off me like water off a duck’s back; there are no hooks left for them to catch on.I'm no longer a container for their trauma; I'm a conduit. A void through which they pass without friction.I'm no longer human. I'm a Void-Construct—a hollow architecture of a man, functioning without the firmware of feeling.I float in the white silence.For the first time since the ritual began, it is truly quiet. The roar of a thousand lifetimes has faded to a whisper, and the whisper has faded to nothing.I exist. I perceive. But I don't feel.It’s the absolute zero of the soul. Cold. Perfect. Empty.The survival mechanism has worked. I have paid for my life with my humanity, and the receipt is printed on the blank slate of my mind.The void responds to my emptiness. It recognizes me now—not as a prisoner, but as an operator.There is no mystical opening of a third eye. No gruesome tearing of skin on my forehead. The change is intrinsic, a rewrite of my optical firmware.My eyes burn.The sensation is torrential, as if someone is pouring liquid nitrogen into my sockets. The sclera flood with ink-black mana, obscuring the white in a rising tide of void. My irises fracture, spinning, reconfiguring into complex golden mandalas that act as Heads-Up Displays for reality itself.I see the 'Source Code' of the manifold scrolling in red glyphs across my vision. It’s a language I have never learned but suddenly understand perfectly. Sans-serif. Brutalist. The raw syntax of creation.I see the Exit protocol. I see the universe rendered as raw data.The 1000 souls aren't screaming anymore; they are processes, background tasks waiting for a task manager to allocate resources.I understand now. Magic isn't a miracle bestowed by gods. It isn't a gift. It's an operating system, and I've just cracked the root password.The smell of ozone and petrichor fills my new senses—the scent of reality being rewritten at the command line. I taste metal and blood, the flavor of my own biology being forcibly upgraded to run high-performance software.My head throbs, not with pain, but with expansion. My skull feels like it’s stretching, cracking, groaning under the pressure of the data flooding into it.I'm no longer a prisoner.I'm the Admin.I reach out with my new perception. Not with hands, but with intent.The Eye of Ajna dissects the manifold’s architecture in microseconds. It highlights boundaries, exit nodes, and causal links in shimmering gold overlays.I don't search for the exit. I declare it.I grab the fabric of the infinite white void with conceptual hands that now wield admin-level authority. I don't ask to leave. I don't pray for release. I command the scene change.'End Instance.'The voice isn't my own. It’s a chorus—the unified will of the 1000 souls I've processed. Their trauma transmuted into raw power. Their screams harmonized into a single, divine imperative.The command echoes through the void with the force of a thunderclap in a cathedral.The white walls shudder. Black cracks web across the infinite expanse like veins of obsidian lightning, splintering the perfection of the prison. The fractal pattern spreads, jagged and beautiful.The manifold, which has held me prisoner for subjective eons, obeys the new logic. It shatters like a dropped mirror. Thousands of shards rain down into nothingness.I fall through the cracks. Not down, but out.The sensation is one of violent acceleration, a rush of motion that feels like being launched from a cannon directly into the heart of the physical world. Gravity grabs me by the throat and pulls.I hit the wet earth hard.Gravity returns with a brutal, welcoming slap. It knocks the wind out of me, compressing lungs that suddenly need air again.I lie there for a moment, tasting mud and ash. The sensation of physical weight settles back into my bones, heavy and undeniable.I'm in the crater—the smoking, ruinous aftermath of the Cavaretta Estate. It’s just a scar in the earth now, under a weeping gray sky. Rain hisses against the scorched ground, washing away the evidence of the ritual in rivulets of gray sludge.I stand up slowly.My limbs feel foreign. Lighter. Hollow. As if my bones are now made of bird-glass, fragile and resonant.I feel… less. The ache of Papa’s loss is still there, a factual entry in my memory, but it is distant now. A file in a closed folder. Not an open wound bleeding meaning into my chest. I poke at the memory and feel only the smooth scar tissue of the Vow.I walk to a puddle formed in the depression of a blast mark and look down.My reflection stares back from the dark water.The sclera are void-black. The irises are intricate gold rings, spinning with the faint, rhythmic pulse of processing data. The Eye of Ajna, freshly opened and fully calibrated, pulses faintly on my brow beneath the skin.I flip the obsidian ring on my finger—the specimen of my sacrifice. The band is cool against my skin, indifferent to the price I paid for it. It is no longer a memento. It is evidence. A relic of the man I used to be.I'm back. I'm awake. And I'm something else entirely.]]></description><link>manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-12-draft.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Projects/Writing/Books/The Cleric Saga/_bmad-output/manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-12-draft.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:17:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[chapter-11-draft]]></title><description><![CDATA[The crystalline shard doesn't shatter. That would imply physics, and we’re distinctly outside of that jurisdiction now. Instead, it undergoes a phase transition—from "object" to "event."One moment, my palm is pressed against the smooth, vibration-dampened surface of the relic, the cold stone sucking the heat right out of my skin. The next, hairline fractures race down its vertical axis like lightning frozen in amber. The runic circle beneath my hand, seconds ago a dim auxiliary glow, blazes with a white-hot intensity that promises to cauterize my retinas if I don't blink.I don't blink. I can't.Then the sound hits.It’s not a noise you hear with your ears. It’s a high-pitched whine that bypasses the auditory nerve entirely and drills directly into my molars, a frequency pitched so high it feels like my skull is being sanded from the inside out. A bass concussion follows—a rhythmic thrum that skips my heartbeat and rattles my occipital bone like a loose tooth in a jar.Ozone. It’s the first thing to hit the senses, but calling it a "smell" is too polite. It’s an assault. The acrid, sterile, burnt-air scent of an electrical storm condensed into the single cubic meter of space I resolve in. It burns the lining of my sinuses, triggering a flash-memory of a blown transformer in the Ward 7-C basement—sparks showering onto wet concrete, the smell of fried insulation and impending darkness.My mouth floods with a metallic copper tang. Capillaries in my nose have burst under the sudden pressure differential. I swallow blood and static.Then the floor evaporates.I fall. Not into the wine cellar floor, not onto damp earth, but into a cold, sucking void that offers no resistance, no friction, and no gravity. My knees buckle into nothingness.The shard begins to scream.It’s not a mechanical feedback loop or a magical hum. It’s a warbling, wet shriek that is unmistakably, horribly human. A chorus of throats tearing themselves apart in unison.Unfiltered soul-data, my mind supplies. The thought comes with the terrifying, crystalline detachment of a man watching his own execution in high-definition. Compression algorithm failure. I just triggered an unhandled exception in sixteen centuries of Cavaretta math.The cellar’s oak racks and damp stone walls begin to glitch. I watch them cascade into white pixels that stutter like corrupted video feed. The Soldatos flanking the circle—men with names, mortgages, favorite football teams—don't even get the dignity of dying. Their screams are truncated mid-syllable, clipped by a surgical edit as the physical world is garbage-collected around me.I look up at the Victorian plaster scrollwork of the ceiling. It unspools like wet tissue paper in a monsoon, revealing a column of roaring white light where the parlor should be.This isn’t destruction, I realize, watching the edges of my own vision begin to fray against the white expanse. This is a de-render. The Shard is treating reality as a memory leak.Panic tries to claw its way up my throat, a biological imperative screaming that falling is bad and dissolving is worse. I shove it down. I’m a combat medic. Panic is a luxury for the triaged, not the triage officer.Assess. Stabilize. Survive.The mantra feels hollow here. There is nothing to stabilize. The environment itself is the wound.My hand spasms, fingers curling into a fist around nothing. The ring on my finger—cold gold, heavy and scarred—burns against my knuckle. Not with heat, but with mass. In a world rapidly losing its definition, it feels impossibly solid. An anchor point in a dissolving sea.Papa.The presence in the metal is faint, static-filled, but it’s there. A stubborn refusal to be deleted.I hold onto that sensation like a drowning man clutching a lifeline. Because right now, it’s the only thing convincing me I still exist.At the epicenter of the white sprawl, Marco Cavaretta is still fighting.Or trying to.His arms are raised, his lips moving in a desperate, frantic counter-chant that should have been command-line authority. In the boardroom, or the ritual circle, that voice moved millions of dollars and bent reality. Here, it’s just noise.Golden threads of mana spiral from his chest—filaments of pure capital, the accumulated "interest" of his lineage. But they aren't forming a shield. They’re being pulled inward. Sucked into the breach by a gravity that ignores the physics of wealth."NO!"Marco’s voice cracks—a raw, wet scream that seems to lag behind the motion of his jaw, like a dubbed movie playing out of sync. "I am the investment!"The words distort, pitch-shifting downward into an ugly, subsonic growl as time itself begins to stutter around him.I watch, paralyzed by the sheer, chaotic wrongness of it. Marco’s fingers elongate, stretching like pulled taffy in a hot room. They unspool into golden filaments that whip toward the singularity’s core.His face follows.I see the skin pull away from the bone like wet clay in a high wind. His features—the arrogance, the fear, the Cavaretta jawline—lose their definition, smearing into streaks of light that are reabsorbed by the void.The scream doesn’t fade. It’s simply clipped. Mid-vowel. As if a surgical hand somewhere in the backend code just deleted the audio track entirely.He’s gone, I think. Just like that.The stench hits me then—not ozone this time, but burnt sugar and rotting meat. The olfactory signature of soul-energy being metabolized. It flashes through the void, cloying and sickening, before vanishing as if the air recyclers just kicked in.I bite my own tongue to keep from joining the chorus of screams that no longer exist. The pain is sharp, specific. The metallic taste of my own blood floods my mouth again. It’s the only thing anchoring me to my own body.He’s being Garbage Collected.The clinical phrase is a flimsy piece of sheet metal against the atrocity unfolding ten feet away, but I hide behind it anyway. The Shard doesn’t care about his lineage. It doesn’t care about his portfolio or his grand designs. It just sees a memory leak that needs to be plugged.The other mages follow in a rhythmic, seismic cascade.Thum-thum-thum.A heartbeat amplified to a scale that rattles my teeth in their sockets.One by one, the Soldatos and the minor mages twist, stretch, and are inhaled. I see a man I recognize—the one who held the door for us—disintegrate into a shower of golden motes. It’s almost beautiful, a kinetic sculpture of golden light and erasing history.If you can ignore the fact that the medium is human lives.Marco wanted godhood. He wanted to ascend. Instead, he’s become high-octane fuel for a machine he never understood.Then the singularity turns.There’s no face to look at, no eyes to meet, but I feel the shift in attention. It swivels toward me like a searchlight made of pure, needle-point need.The heartbeat accelerates. Thum-thum-thum-thum.Ozone floods back, sharp and electric. A tugging sensation begins at the center of my chest. It’s not physical—it’s not pulling on my skin or my clothes. It’s pulling on me.Something is trying to extract my meaning from my meat.Appetizers are done, I think, a hysterical bubble of laughter rising in my throat. Time for the main course.Bianco Cavaretta isn’t screaming anymore. He’s past the point of vocalization, sliding across the frictionless white expanse of the manifold with his fingers clawing at a vacuum.His shadow, the only dark thing in a world of blinding data, stretches toward the singularity’s core like pulled taffy. A physical representation of the existential weight trying to drag him into the recycle bin."BODHI!"The name breaches the hush, a raw, hoarse shriek that cuts through the white noise of a collapsing reality.I look at him. His eyes are fixed on mine, wide and glazed with the absolute terror of a man who just realized his invisibility has finally failed him. He’s the Sidekick. The comic relief. The guy who survives because he’s not important enough to kill.But the Shard doesn’t know narrative tropes. It just eats.I feel the tug at my own chest intensify. The Shard’s hunger focuses into a needle-point of demand, drilling into my sternum.I should let him go.The thought is cold, rational. Survival of the fittest. Triage protocol: save the salvageable. Bianco is dead weight. He’s a Cavaretta. He’s part of the rot.But my body moves before my brain can sign off on the ethics. The combat-medic reflex—the hardwired biological imperative to fix, to save—fires hot and fast, overriding the logic.Some Ol’ Bullshit, I think with a sudden, warped clarity. Protagonists make the sacrifice plays. It’s in the script.I look at the singularity’s core. I don't see a god. I don't see a monster. I see a system. A spiral of golden metadata representing a compression algorithm.And I see the lag.There. A microsecond window between reclamation cycles. A stutter in the frame rate.If I overclock my own conceptual mass, the calculation runs itself in the back of my mind, I can create a local exception. A priority object too heavy to process. For exactly one millisecond.My hands blaze.I don’t cast a spell. I open a wound in the fabric of the world.The Blood-black Ouroboros manifests in a roar of anti-light, the serpent eating its own tail in a loop of creative destruction. It feels like shoving my arm into a blast furnace. The entropy screams through my channels, turning my veins into lines of molten lead.I don’t aim at Bianco. I aim past him. Into the fold of space where the estate’s wards are flickering like a dying lightbulb.The recoil is immense.A concussive pop of displaced air rushes to fill the vacuum I just created. My shoulder dislocates with a wet, sickening crunch. The pain is dazzling, white-hot and immediate, grounding me in the moment.The healing loop fires automatically, snapping the bone back into the socket before I can even scream. The grinding of cartilage sounds like rocks in a blender."EXIT!"The word rips from my throat, raw and bloody.The blast hits Bianco like a freight train of concentrated nothingness. It hurls him sideways, knocking him out of the singularity’s gravity well and through a chaotic fold in spacetime.I watch him vanish into a burst of blue light—the ward boundary accepting him like a swimmer breaking the surface.He’s out. Safe. The Sidekick has his reprieve.The singularity roars.It’s a frustrated, hungry sound that vibrates the atoms of my skeleton. The anchor I created by overclocking myself shatters instantly. The tugging at my chest becomes a violent pull.I lose my footing—or what passes for footing in this void. I begin to slide toward the core, my feet scrabbling uselessly on a ground that is no longer there.I taste blood. I taste triumph.Narrative satisfied, I think, spitting a glob of red into the white. Sidekick saved. Now, the Protagonist faces the Boss.My shoulder throbs in time with the singularity’s heartbeat.Thum-thum-thum.Bring it on, I think. And the void answers.From my vantage point in the basement void—though "basement" is a memory and "void" is an understatement—I watch the world end.The upper floors of the Cavaretta estate don't just fall; they fold.It’s a slow-motion catastrophe. Victorian masonry, prize-winning privacy hedges, centuries of accrued architectural arrogance—all of it compresses into a spiraling column of debris racing toward the singularity’s maw. The estate isn't being destroyed. It’s being sucked into a vacuum that doesn’t recognize the concept of "up," "down," or "structural integrity."A groaning, tearing cacophony fills the space between my ears. Wood splintering like dry bones. Stone cracking with the sound of gunshot. Glass shattering in a continuous, crystalline scream. The destruction is layered into a single, dissonant chord that vibrates in the marrow of my bones.The air is thick with the scent of dying history. Ancient dust, older than the country itself. The sharp ozone of rain. The copper tang of exposed plumbing ripped from the walls. It creates an olfactory profile that I can only describe as house death.Then gravity inverts.My stomach lurches into my throat. I feel myself being pulled up—or what used to be up—toward the collapsing structure. It’s as if I’m standing on the ceiling of existence, watching the floor fall away into the sky.Above me—or below, the distinction is meaningless now—the sky is visible through the gaps in the maelstrom. A swirling vortex of clouds is being sucked downward, dragging the stars with it. They flicker like dying embers in a storm, winking out one by one as they cross the event horizon.This is what a god’s tantrum looks like, I think. The metatextual part of my brain is still running its commentary track, frantically trying to categorize the apocalypse into something manageable. The Shard is throwing a fit because someone poked it wrong. Some Ol’ Bullshit divine petulance.I watch a gargoyle—one of the estate’s Gothic grotesques—tumble past me. As it crosses the threshold of the singularity, it stretches. Stone softens into putty. The face contorts, its silent snarl warping into something almost expressive—a mask of stone-cold terror—before it vanishes into the white.The groaning of the building shifts. It deepens, smoothing out into a low, resonant hum. It sounds like a choir hitting a bass note that’s too low for the human ear to resolve, but perfect for the soul to tremble at. As if the singularity is finally singing a song it’s been composing for centuries.A chandelier, still lit by some absurd miracle of electrical persistence, spirals past me. Crystal pendants catch the white light, scattering rainbows into the void before it hits the core and is gone.And then, I am alone.I am the last object with mass in a world of light.Silence follows. It’s not a peaceful quiet. It’s a complete, absolute, aggressive silence. A weight against my eardrums. The air is gone, stripped away by the vacuum, leaving only the sterile nothingness of raw mana. Even the memory of scent has been deleted.The singularity knows I have nowhere to go. It’s not rushing anymore. It pulses. Constant. Steady. Patient.I am the last data point in the file. And the file is being closed.Subjective time dissolves. There are no seconds, only frames.My reality becomes a low-bandwidth video feed struggling to keep up with the data rate of a dying universe. Flickering images. Stuttering motion.My body rotates without my consent. My feet rise above my head as "up" becomes "in." The singularity’s core is no longer a point in the distance; it’s an aperture. A massive, dilated pupil pulsing with a sickly golden light that promises the end of individuality.I’m drifting toward it like a satellite in a decaying orbit.A sound fills my skull—a digital rising tone, pure and piercing. It reminds me of the old dial-up modems, the sound of connection being established. The sound of a loading bar inching toward 99%. It vibrates my teeth. It vibrates my thoughts.Then the pixelation begins.It starts at my fingertips. I feel a tingling numbness, like circulation being cut off, but sharper. Cleaner. I look at my hand.My fingers are no longer flesh. They are data.Rectangles of colored light stutter where my knuckles should be. They flicker, rearranging themselves, converting from biology into a more efficient format.I am becoming a file attachment, I think. The metaphor is absurd, a desperate joke cracked by a mind trying to armor itself against the terror of its own disappearance. High-bandwidth transfer. Some Ol’ Bullshit upload.The pixelation spreads. My hands fade to translucent. I can see my veins—not as vessels carrying blood, but as lines of glowing code beneath thinning skin.I’m not dying. Dying is messy. Dying is rot and decay. This is formatting. Cold data is replacing warm blood. Information is overwriting the messy redundancies of my biology.And it hurts. Not like a wound, but like an amputation of the self.The ring on my finger burns.It’s a sudden, violent flare of presence against the numbness. My father’s transfigured form, the gemstone I’ve carried through fire and blood, is fighting the dissolution.It turns hot. Then cold. Then hot again. It pulses against my pixelating finger, an anchor dragging in the mud, refusing to let the ship drift.Dad’s still in the ring, I realize. I clutch at the phantom sensation with a hand that is increasingly made of light. He’s the only thing keeping me from being completely rewritten. The only thing with enough weight to survive the transition.My vision blurs. Then it sharpens—but into something other.I’m seeing the metadata of reality. The underlying code that defines shape and mass and time. The smooth white of the void resolves into streams of logic, equations describing the absence of matter. The sustained tone in my head fractures into harmonics—a chord of frequencies that describes the actual meaning of emptiness.For a moment, I taste something.Not blood. Not static.Burnt sandalwood.My mother’s favorite incense. Sharp, woody, comforting. It shouldn't be here. There is no air to carry it. But it floods my senses, a memory bleeding through the firewall of my mind.Then the transition hits its peak.The world collapses into a tunnel of rushing information. Bodhi Rao—the doctor, the healer, the man who said "Fuck Magic"—dissolves.I am no longer a solid object. I am a stream of light hurtling into the dark.Upload complete. Welcome to the Manifold.DATA COMPRESSION ERROR.
RATIO: INFINITE.
ARCHIVE CORRUPTED.Grey.A limitless, suffocating expanse of grey.Not darkness. Darkness has depth. This is flat. This is static. The visual snow of a detuned television, amplified to cosmic proportions and projected onto the inside of the universe’s skull.I float in the center of it. Weightless. Formless.I am acutely aware of the absence of my own biology. I don't breathe, because there is no air. I don't blink, because I have no eyelids. I simply perceive.The sound is omnidirectional. A hissing roar of white noise that seems to originate from nowhere and everywhere at once. It’s not the aggressive silence of the void. This is the sound of a system waiting for input. The sound of a Loading Screen.Great, I think, though I’m not sure what I’m thinking with. I’m stuck in the lobby.I look down—or what my mind insists is "down."A single point of solid color burns in the grey.The ring.It’s still there. Circling a phantom finger I can no longer feel, glowing with a soft, pulsing amber light. The white noise seems to recede around the metal, as if the ring creates a bubble of coherence in an ocean of noise.Sandalwood.I can smell it again, stronger now. It’s not just incense. It’s his aftershave. A sharp, clean scent that used to cling to his flannel shirts. It shouldn’t have survived the upload. Impossible.But the impossible is the only thing that works here. It’s a metadata override. A user-defined variable that refuses to be cleared.Dad, I think.And for the first time in what feels like centuries, I feel a tear.It’s real. I can taste the salt. I can feel the wet track on a cheek that shouldn't exist.You’re still holding on. You’re still the anchor.The static begins to thin.Vague, ominous shapes coalesce in the distance. Monoliths of shadow standing patient and silent in the grey. The white noise resolves into whispers. A thousand voices, too quiet to parse, muttering just at the edge of perception. Each one a thread of biography being pulled from the Manifold’s archives.A new scent floods the vacuum, overpowering the sandalwood.Old flowers. Roses and lilies. The cloying, heavy sweetness of a funeral arrangement left too long in a warm room.Reality is buffering. The next scene is loading.A pressure builds in the space where my chest used to be. Not physical pressure, but existential. The sense that something vast—something ancient and hungry—is finally noticing me.The Loading Screen is over. The Main Program is starting.And I am not ready.The Main Program doesn't load. It invades.No signal. Anywhere.That’s the first thing I know, because "seeing" is gone—not darkness, not black, not even the mercy of a void I can imagine. Just the absence of visual data. It’s like someone yanked the optic cable out of my brain and left the port open to the wind.The grey static from the Loading Screen clears, and I’m blind.And then the pressure arrives.It’s not on my skin. It’s not on my lungs. It’s on me.A low, throbbing hum replaces the whispers, bass so deep it vibrates phantom bones I’m not sure I still own. It’s the kind of frequency you feel in your teeth at concerts when the speakers are too big for the room.Except the room is existence. And the speakers are screaming.The smell of old flowers intensifies—roses, lilies, chrysanthemums. The heavy, cloying sweetness of viewing rooms and open caskets. It suffocates me, a blanket of perfumed death trying to cover up the truth: something rotting is nearby.Salt stays on my tongue. Grief made tangible.Weight stacks on top of weight.At first it’s subtle, like the moment after you step into a crowd and you can tell the air is thick with other people’s moods. Then it multiplies. It crushes from all sides—psychic pressure, emotional gravity, the accumulated grief of a thousand souls pressing against the inside of my skull.The shard’s battery is aware.And it’s reaching for me.My hands—do I have hands?—go cold with instinct. My left heel exists. My right doesn't. My spine is a question mark drawn in trembling chalk.I’ve been here before.Not in cosmic static, sure, but in Ward 7-C, when your body is detoxing and your brain is a broken radio picking up stations from hell. The only way you survive the flood is by building a wall between "you" and "everything."Nurse Padma, I think, grabbing at the memory like a jagged rock. Four count. In-two-three-four. Hold-two-three-four.Mental Firewall.Dissociation as a tool, not a curse. A survival separation.I close my nonexistent eyes. I build the firewall anyway.First layer: Breath.
Except there is no breath, so I simulate it. I force the concept of lungs to expand against the pressure. In. Hold. Out. Hold. The rhythm gives my mind rails. A track to run on so it doesn't derail into the dark.Second layer: Body.
Except there is no body, so I draw one in my head. Skeleton. Muscle. Skin. I map the boundaries. Here is where I end. Here is where the world begins. I trace the lines of my own silhouette in mental neon.Third layer: Name.
Bodhi Rao.
The words are a pin hammered into the concept of self. I am Bodhi Rao. I am a combat medic. I am the son of Dinesh Rao. Use the details to staple the ego to the soul.For one heartbeat, it works.The hum fractures into individual frequencies. Not words—impressions. Personalities.Fear that tastes like iron.
Rage that smells like diesel.
Resignation that feels like a heavy wool blanket pulled up to your chin.Hospital antiseptic bleeds into the funeral flowers. The scent of death mixing with the desperate, sterile attempt to prevent it.Metal fills my mouth. I realize I’m biting my phantom lip again. Hard.Good. Pain is still an address. Pain means I'm home.The ring warms under my grip.
Papa.
Presence against the flood.Then the firewall buckles.Not gradually. Not politely.
It buckles like a dam in an earthquake. A catastrophic, structural failure of the self.A thousand lifetimes slam into me at once.Within the Shard, the first thing that arrives is noise pretending to be memory—raw packets of terror slamming into my psyche faster than thought can label them.But one packet is louder than the rest. One memory isn't noise. It's the Missing Frame.The whiteout un-pauses.Bang. Bang. Bang."Asset Retrieval," the voice booms. Not a Soldato. An Orderly. The bored, terrifying indifference of the incinerator crew."Protocol mandates immediate processing."In the memory, I look at Papa. I look at the Ring. The distance between them is zero, but the distance between "Life" and "Object" is infinite. And I am about to bridge it."DISMANTLE."I don't target the room. I target the probability. I grab the soul—the math, the essence, the him—and I rip it out of the biology.I watch the violation happen. I watch flesh collapse into geometry. I watch the warm, messy, beautiful chaos of a human life get compressed, crushed, and formatted into the cold lattice of obsidian.Flesh -&gt; Math -&gt; Stone.The universe shrieks. A wet, tearing sound of a fundamental law being broken. Samsara weeping as I force a square peg into a round hole.
__pain.__ Maa! &nbsp;
No one, Maa...Papa-- no one told me! No one helped me!
The words aren’t heard so much as injected. A child’s panic wearing my tongue. I taste the salt of tears that aren't mine. I feel the wrenching sob in a throat I don't possess. Didn't tell me! Didn't Help me at all!
No one! My Heart...
The pressure squeezes inward—an existential hand around my throat. I try to find the firewall again and come up holding only static.Factory smoke. 1887. Metal shavings in my lungs. The scream of a steam whistle that means someone just lost a hand.
Not mine, I scream inwardly. Not my lungs!
I can **do** this! Keep....keep it together...pull yourself back together.
I reach for breath and grab emptiness. I reach for body and find… gaps. My proprioception flickers. I have six fingers. I have no fingers. I have a thousand hands and they are all grasping.
I can pull this tog-- _pain . it hurts_... Arms aren't-- &nbsp;
...my hands are missing...
My awareness flails where my limbs should be. The shard doesn’t care. It keeps streaming.Sweat. Blood. 1901. A midwife's rough hands. The tearing pain of childbirth that splits the world in two. A joy so sharp it feels like terror. I. Can **DO**. this.
MY HANDS!
Maa!
**Mama!**
I’ll kill you for this. My birthday-- I will kill you.
The threat isn’t mine. The fury fits anyway, like grief always does when it’s looking for a place to live. It slides into the grooves of my own anger, lubricating the mechanism.
Mama. Papa. Mama. Papa. Mama. Papa. Mama. Papa.
So cold. Hurting. **Monsters**!
Hurting.
My heart isn't beating.
The hum beneath reality fractures into personalities—impressions without words—until the impressions become a crowd. A mob in my mind.Cordite. Mud. The sun rising over a trench. A cigarette burning between trembling fingers. A moment of peace before the whistle blows. Don't make me go over, the soldier thinks. Please don't make me go over.
I don't want to go over, I think.
We don't want to go over.
I hear so many **voices.**
Shard.
Mama. Papa.
A boy.

C̷A̵V̸A̸R̵E̵T̵T̶A̴,̵ ̷Y̶O̷U̶ ̴F̷U̶C̵K̷.̸
**Eating me!!!**
_**AGGHH!!!**_
The ring flares hot-cold against a finger that shouldn’t exist—Dinesh’s presence bracing like a shoulder under a door. The sandalwood scent spikes, sharp and woody, cutting through the rot of the flowers.
Hold on, the ring seems to say. Or maybe I'm saying it to myself. Or maybe we are saying it.
I. Can. Do. **THIS!** Mama. Papa. Mama. Papa. Mama. Papa. Mama. Papa. Mama. Papa. Mama. Papa. Mama. Papa. Mama. Papa. Mama. Papa. Mama. Papa. Mama. Papa. Mama. Papa. I can hold ourselves..._pull_ myself back together.
Whose hand is this?
I look at the limb in my mind. It has calluses from a loom. It has scars from a blade. It has the smooth skin of a child.
It is my hand. It is our hand.
Where's that boy that was just--
_Somebody please help us!_
**MY HEART ISN'T BEATING INSIDE MY CHEST!!!**
I- I _know_ we can do this... Cavaretta!
**We** can do this! We saw Cavaretta! Saw you with the s-Stone, Marco-with-the-hairplugs-Caveretta. CAVERETTA did it!
The name unleashes a fresh wave.
Not just Marco. His father. His grandfather.
You took my daughter.
You stole my shop.
You burned my farm.
You promised to heal me.
The accusations layer over each other, a sediment of hate built up over centuries. And I feel the guilt. Not because I did it. But because I healed him. I fixed the monster's heart so it could keep beating.
I helped, I realized. We helped.
Think of our Mamas. Think of our Papas.
Think of Marco.

Shard's still eating at me.
Shard's still eating at my Ego. &nbsp;
That's fine.
Just let it.
Just let it.
As long as we remember our--- ...hurting.
The ring burns. It’s unbearable now. A brand of heat against the cold.
It digs into the flesh of a finger that is rapidly becoming a concept rather than a limb.
He isn't letting go.
My father is stubborn. He’s always been stubborn.
And I... I am a monster.
The Stone.
"I didn't save him. I harvested him."
Oh, my God-- I turned my Papa into a stone.

AND WE
We…
…and…
And ...who...who exactly are we?
we...are...Bodhi? Bodhisunya?
The name feels strange in our mouth. Foreign. A sound someone else makes.
It's a ... strange name...for a child...isn't it?
We think my mama choose it for us...or was it papa...it must have been one of them or the other right?
We believe our papa had strong hands...big strong hands...do you know him?...do we know him...? Our papa...
We remember hands. Rough palms. Smelling of turmeric and surgical soap. Sunday mornings. The steam of coffee shifting the light in the kitchen.
He must have lifted us and carried us in those hands once
We can feel his hands...
Or did we carry him?
He seemed so small the last time we saw him
The last time we held him he was so small
The memory shifts. Darkens. The basement. The ritual. The smell of burning flesh that was also our flesh.
He could fit in our hands
He could fit on our finger
The realization hits us like a hammer to the oscillating bone.The ring.
The stone.
The weight on our hand.
We think...we believe...we dream...?
He gave us this ring you know?
Our favorite ring.
Silence. A beat of pure, crystalline horror.
We wish they would come and see us sometime.
Our mama. Our papa. They're both so far away. Where did our parents go? Why didn't they take us with them?
The guilt breaks the last firewall.
We turned him into a thing. We trapped him in the metal to save ourselves.
He is watching us dissolve. He is holding our hand while we disappear.I killed him. The Ritual is a failure. I killed my father. And I turned him into a ring. And now people are going to die. Including me. I failed.
We Want...we want our mama...we want our mama we want our papa...
Please, we just want our mama and papa to come and get us and take us home. Please just let us go home. We just want to go home. We want our mama.
Please mama.
Images burst across the blindness like lightning behind eyelids.
A child’s birthday party—1942, paper hats, ration-cake, a laugh that ends too abruptly when the door opens and the adults stop smiling.
A surgeon’s hands—1887, blood up to the wrists, knuckles raw from scrubbing, eyes that don’t blink because blinking wastes time.
A soldier’s final sunrise—trenches, cordite and mud, breath steaming, a cigarette held between trembling fingers like it’s a sacrament.Each flash comes with a full-body memory.
Smoke.
Perfume.
Bread.
Blood.
Cordite.
Cough syrup.
Wet wool.
The sound of a train.
The taste of a final meal.
The taste of a kiss goodbye.
The taste of a tear swallowed in silence.Everything.Our "self" starts to fray at the edges. Not peeling, but dissolving. Like sugar in hot tea.
Bodhi becomes porous.
The Shard, without malice, merely tries to fit the deluge of memory in the only vessel available to it.
A container big enough to hold the archive.
A format that won’t reject the upload.The flood rewrites the narrator.Our thoughts splinter into broken shards of language—some ours, some borrowed, all sharp. Names repeat until they become a spell. Accusations surface like buoyant corpses. The Cavaretta curse fits our mouth too perfectly.No sound. Only thought.
Only the pressure.
Only the sense of being eaten from the inside.Our Mental Firewall tries to rebuild itself automatically, like scar tissue forming over and over in the same place.
It costs.
We feel something tear in the conceptual muscle behind our eyes.
A migraine without a skull.
A nausea without a stomach.
A panic without lungs.The ring burns with presence, fighting to keep one thread of us intact.
Papa, we think, and it comes out as an anchor line thrown into a storm.
The warmth answers—faint, stubborn.
A grip.
But the flood is bigger than grip.The firewall splits.
And the grief crashes through like a tidal wave.We drown.
In lives.
In last breaths.
In the terrible, intimate physics of other people’s endings.The final, clean boundary inside our mind—Bodhi Rao—warps under the weight.We feel ourselves becoming plural.
Not metaphorically.
Literally.
We.We are cold.
We are hurting.
We are missing our hands.
We are screaming for our mamas and Papas and gods that never answered.
We are furious.
We are afraid.And somewhere deep inside the swarm, a small, bright thought flickers—mine, we think, mine—and it is so petty and human it almost makes us laugh.Fuck.
Magic.Then the shard leans in.
The weight increases.
More voices queue at the door.And the last thing we feel…before any semblance of "I" becomes an outdated file format…is the ring pressing hot-cold against a finger that shouldn’t exist.
My father refusing to let the archive take everything without a fight.The fight doesn’t feel heroic.
It feels like being held under.
And learning, too late, that we can drown in anything.We reach out.
Not with a hand, but with a need."We are coming, mama…papa," we whisper, and the voice is a thousand voices.The Manifold winks out.Bodhi Rao is no longer a man. ]]></description><link>manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-11-draft.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Projects/Writing/Books/The Cleric Saga/_bmad-output/manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-11-draft.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:17:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[chapter-10-draft]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Cavaretta Estate didn't just sit on the hill; it loomed, a Victorian tumor of brick and ivy metastasizing from the damp earth of New Canaan.I stepped out of the taxi—the driver didn't want to come up the driveway, and I didn't blame him—and my boots crunched onto the imported Venetian gravel. The sound was too loud in the silence, a percussive announcement that Bodhi Rao, the unlicensed miracle worker, the "containment specialist," the fraud, had arrived to perform his final trick.November mist clung to the grounds like gauze on a festering wound, dampening the sound but prioritizing the smell. And god, did it smell. Not just the pine sap and woodsmoke of the surrounding woods, but something sweeter, thicker. The cloying scent of money sweating out its toxins. It smelled like expensive cigars and old blood, a boutique abattoir for the gentry.I adjusted my collar, a useless gesture against the chill that was radiating from the obsidian ring pressed against my sternum.The ring.I didn't remember putting it on. I just remembered the weight. A week? Seems longer. It felt heavy enough to bruise bone—neutron star density packed into a loop that should have weighed ounces. It pulsed against my skin, a hot, scorching rhythm that didn't match my heartbeat. Thum-thum... thum. Like a signal struggling to find a carrier wave.Diagnostic scan, I told myself, slipping into the clinical detachment that had kept me sane through three years of back-alley surgeries. Assess the patient. Ignore the prognosis.I looked at the house. My "Eye of Ajna"—the diagnostic sight I usually reserved for failing organs—flickered open without a conscious command. The world desaturated. The brickwork faded to grey wireframes, and the mist dissolved into data.The estate was screaming.Thaumic wards wrapped the structure in layers of suffocating complexity—ancient Roman protection circles spliced with modern security glyphs, a sloppy, brute-force architecture that leaked mana like a sieve. It was "Spaghetti Code" of the worst kind, generations of paranoid sorcerers patching over each other’s work until the original intent was buried under centuries of cruft."Amateurs," I whispered, the word smoking in the cold air.The Blood-black Ouroboros stirred in my marrow. It wasn't a spell I had prepared; it was a parasite I was hosting. A subsonic vibration that rattled my teeth, a hunger waiting for a menu.And the ring... the ring was hungry too.As I crossed the boundary of the wards, the pressure against my chest spiked. But it wasn't pushing back. It was inhaling. The obsidian inlay drank the frequency of the barrier, a "Mana Sink" swallowing the energy like a black hole eating a star. The wards didn't flicker; they just... dimmed. A localized brown-out in the magical architecture, centered entirely on my sternum.Easy, I thought at the snake, and the stone. Dinner is coming. Don't spoil your appetite.I walked toward the mahogany double doors, my hands thrust deep into my pockets to hide the tremor. I wasn't shaking from fear. I was shaking because I was holding a grenade with the pin pulled, and the explosion was the only exit strategy I had left.The doors swung inward before I could knock.Bianco Cavaretta stood in the violently lit foyer, a silhouette cut from anxiety and expensive fabric. He looked younger than the last time I’d seen him, shrinking inside a suit that cost more than my father’s life insurance policy. His eyes were wide, rimmed with the red exhaustion of a man who sleeps with one eye on the exit."You came," he whispered. His voice was a thread, vibrating with the high-frequency terror of a prey animal caught in the lights.I stepped across the threshold, the warmth of the foyer hitting me like a physical blow. "I'm a man of my word, Bianco. Even when the word is a lie."He flinched, glancing toward the east wing where voices—loud, confident, dangerous—echoed off the vaulted ceiling. "My uncle... he thinks you're a specialist. A 'Containment Architect' from the Vatican underground.""I know what he thinks," I said, my voice flat. "I wrote the script."Bianco swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing. He looked at my chest, seemingly drawn by the invisible gravity of the ring hidden beneath my shirt. For a second, his terror broke, replaced by a jagged confusing. "You feel... wrong. Bodhi, the air around you is... heavy.""That's just the luggage," I said, brushing past him. "Take me to the prep room. Before I lose my nerve."Bianco led me through a side corridor that smelled of formaldehyde and lavender—the specific, nauseating perfume of a funeral home trying to pass as a spa.The "Preparation Anteroom" was a glorified pantry, its shelves lined not with food for the living but with snacks for the dead. Glass jars filled with amber fluid held things that might have been organs, or might have been alchemical mistakes. I saw a preserved hand with six fingers, a heart that seemed to be made of quartz, and a row of canaries that were motionless but definitely not dead."He tests on them," Bianco said, catching my stare. "The Shard... it hums. It hurts my teeth. It ate the bird last week. It didn't kill it, Bodhi. The bird just... stopped updating. Like a frozen screen."I froze, my hand halfway to the ceremonial robe draped over a chair. Stopped updating."Show me," I said.Bianco pointed to the third jar. Inside, the canary hung suspended in the fluid, its wings spread mid-flight. But looking closer, the feathers weren't blurred by motion. They were pixelated. The edges of the wings dissolved into tiny, perfect squares of yellow light."Glitch," I murmured. The diagnosis was immediate and sickening. "The local reality rendering engine can't process the object state."Bianco looked at me like I was speaking Aramaic. "What?""Nothing." I grabbed the robe—heavy black silk embroidered with silver thread that felt greasy to the touch. "Your uncle is playing with a debugger he doesn't understand."I stripped off my jacket, folding it neatly on a workbench stained with old reagents. I transferred the ring from my shirt pocket to a hidden fold in the robe's inner lining, placing it directly over my heart. The warmth of the stone bled through the fabric, deeper than skin, settling into the intercostal muscles like a heated stone massage gone wrong."Why are you helping him?" I asked, watching Bianco’s reflection in the glass of the specimen jar. "You know he’s going to kill Vincenzo. You know this isn't a cure."Bianco hunched his shoulders, looking suddenly like a child. "Because he's family. And because... if I don't help, I'm next.""Self-preservation," I nodded, clinical. "The most honest diagnostic there is.""And you?" Bianco turned, his eyes searching my face for a savior he wouldn't find. "Why are you here? You barely know us. You hate magic."I paused, my thumb tracing the outline of the obsidian ring through the silk. The surface felt sleek, friction-free, like touching a hole in the world.Because my father is currently a zip file on a hard drive I stole from death, I thought. And your uncle built the only computer powerful enough to unzip him."I'm here for a second opinion," I said aloud. "And to make sure no one else gets 'deleted' tonight."The lie tasted like copper. I wasn't here to save anyone. I was here to hijack a ritual. If saving Bianco was a byproduct, great. If not... well, triage is a bitch.I pulled the hood up. "Let's go. Don't keep the monster waiting."The drawing room was an arena masked as a lounge.Three mages stood in a loose semi-circle around the fireplace, their postures stiff, their eyes flicking toward the door as we entered. I clocked them instantly—"Licensed" practitioners. You could tell by the way they held themselves: arrogant but leashed. They wore the Empire's seal like a badge of honor, unaware it was a barcode.Marco Cavaretta sat in a wingback chair that looked like a throne, swirling a glass of liquid that was too dark to be wine. He looked up, his face a landscape of sharp angles and expensive skin treatments."The Specialist," Marco said. His voice was a deep, resonant baritone—a voice trained to give orders that ended lives. "You're late.""Precision is never late," I said, channeling every ounce of the sardonic, burnout medic persona I’d curated. "It arrives exactly when the variables align. Or would you prefer I rushed the containment fields and turned your estate into a crater?"Marco smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. His eyes were dead things, shark-black and empty. "I prefer results. These are your battery packs." He gestured loosely to the three mages.One of them—a silver-haired woman with the sharp, predatory gaze of a corporate lawyer—stepped forward. "We are conduits, Mr. Cavaretta. Not batteries. Results require respect."Mistake, I flagged it instantly. Never negotiate with a tumor.Marco didn't even blink. "You are what I pay you to be. And tonight, you are input."I walked past them, ignoring the glares. My attention was fixed on the holographic schematic floating above the coffee table—a blueprint of the ritual circle.I scanned it with my diagnostic eye.Energy Input: 4 Sources.
Throughput Capacity: Unlimited.
Filter Protocols: Disabled.
Safety Margins: None.My blood ran cold. The math was wrong. Explicitly, aggressively wrong."Four sources?" I asked, pointing at the glowing nodes. "You have three mages."Marco took a sip of his drink. "And you, Mr. Rao. The Specialist must anchor the field, correct? That requires... connection."I looked at the mages. They weren't just conduits. They were fuel. And so was I. Marco didn't intend to "channel" the Philosopher's Stone to heal his brother. He intended to crack the Shard open and feed it four souls to jumpstart his own immortality.It wasn't a surgery. It was a harvest."Standard protocol," I lied, keeping my voice steady even as my adrenal gland dumped a cocktail of fight-or-flight into my bloodstream. "But I'll need proximity to the Shard. To... modulate the frequency.""Granted," Marco stood up. The air in the room seemed to drop five degrees. "We go down now. Vincenzo is fading."I glanced at the corner, where a medical stretcher sat in the shadows. Vincenzo Cavaretta—the brother, the excuse for all this madness—was a husk. Skeletal, grey, barely breathing. He wasn't a patient; he was a prop.Triage status: Black Tag, I noted. Unsalvageable."After you," I said to Marco.The briefing was short, brutal, and entirely for show.As we walked, Marco explained the "phases" of the ritual, using words like "harmonics" and "resonance" that he clearly didn't understand. It was cargo-cult alchemy—he was mimicking the motions of power without understanding the mechanics."The Shard requires a primer," Marco said as we reached the heavy iron door of the cellar. "A spark to open the aperture. That's where you come in, Rao. Your... unique talent for void-magic. You open the door. They—" he pointed to the mages, "—keep it open. I step through."He knows, I realized. He knows I'm a Void-Cleric. Or at least, he knows I'm not a standard mage.My hand strayed to my chest, pressing against the ring through the robe. The warmth was intensifying. It wasn't just heat anymore; it was mass. The ring felt like it weighed fifty pounds.Null Variable, I thought. That’s the play.Marco's ritual was built on a closed loop: 4 Inputs -&gt; Shard -&gt; Marco.
But he was assuming standard inputs. Clean mana. Licensed souls. Compliant variables.He wasn't accounting for a Null Variable. A variable that equals zero. Or negative infinity.If I fed the Shard the ring—if I fed it the Null Variable—it wouldn't be like pouring gas on a fire. It would be like pouring concrete into an engine.The "System" of the Shard would try to process the data I had compressed into the obsidian. But the data wasn't just raw mana. It was complex. Healed. Condensed.Buffer Underrun, the hacker part of my brain whispered. Feed the system a file it can't read, and watch the kernel panic.I wasn't killing him. I was migrating him."You're quiet, Specialist," Marco said, pausing with his hand on the door latch."Just calculating safety margins," I said."There are no safety margins," Marco grinned, and for a second, I saw the madness underneath the suit. "That's why I hired you."He opened the door.The descent was less like walking into a basement and more like lowering yourself into a reactor core.The stairs were stone, slick with condensation that smelled of iron and ozone. The air grew colder with every step, a biting, unnatural chill that ignored the fabric of my robe and went straight for the marrow.Server Room temperature, I noted. Keep the hardware cool.We emerged into the wine cellar, but the wine had been evicted. The space had been gutted, the floor lowered, and the walls reinforced with lead plating.In the center of the room, suspended in a magnetic containment field that hummed with a headache-inducing whine, was the Shard.I had expected a crystal. A gem. Something beautiful.It wasn't.It was a Dead Pixel.A jagged, absolute black hole in the air, roughly the size of a human heart. It didn't reflect light; it drank it. The floodlights Marco had rigged up around the circle seemed to bend toward it, their beams warping and vanishing into the void of the object.Looking at it made my eyes water. My brain tried to reject what it was seeing, filling in the gap with static. It was an object that violated the rendering rules of the universe."Beautiful," Marco whispered."It's a glitch," I said, my voice barely audible."It's power," Marco corrected. He turned to the mages. "Positions."The mages took their places on three points of the etched runic circle—North, East, West."South," Marco pointed to the spot directly in front of the Shard. "Specialist."I walked to the South point. The proximity to the Shard was nauseating. I could hear it now—not a hum, but a whisper. A thousand voices overlapping, screaming, crying, begging.Unfiltered soul-data, I realized with a jolt of horror. This isn't a battery. It's a hard drive. A storage device for everyone it's ever eaten.I took my place. I looked at Bianco, who was standing by the wall, trembling.Get ready to run, kid, I projected the thought, hoping he could read my posture."Begin," Marco commanded.The mages began to chant.It wasn't Latin. It wasn't Enochian. It was pure, guttural noise—a harmonic frequency designed to resonate with the Shard.The effect was instantaneous.The Shard pulsed. The Dead Pixel expanded.And the pain hit.It wasn't pain like a cut or a burn. It was extraction. I felt a hook sink into my chest—not my physical chest, but the concept of "Me." It snagged my vitality, my mana, the very electricity keeping my synapses firing, and it pulled.I gasped, my knees buckling. I saw the silver-haired mage to my left scream silently, her eyes rolling back as red mist began to vent from her pores.It's eating us, I thought, panic flaring. It's not waiting for the primer. It's just hungry."Hold it!" Marco roared, stepping toward the circle. "Stabilize the flow!""I... can't..." the male mage on the East point choked out. His skin was turning grey, aging decades in seconds. "It's... too... heavy..."The Ouroboros in my bones woke up.It felt the threat—the predation—and it reacted with the hostility of an apex predator defending its territory. Black lightning crackled down my arms, visible even in the dim light. The Entropic Divinity didn't want to be eaten. It wanted to eat.Not yet, I gritted my teeth, forcing the Ouroboros down. Wait for the opening.I looked at the Shard. The aperture was widening. I could see swirls of gold and violet inside the black—the raw data of consumed souls."Now!" Marco screamed at me. "Open it fully, Specialist! Or I bury you here!"I looked at him. I looked at the Shard."You want it open?" I snarled, my voice sounding like grinding stones.I reached into my robe.My hand closed around the ring.It burned. Cold fire. The sensation of touching dry ice.I ripped it from the hidden pocket. The movement was sluggish, like fighting through deep water. The Shard's gravity was distorting time, slowing down my motor functions.Marco saw the ring. His eyes widened. "What is that? That's not the focus!""This," I shouted, holding the obsidian band up to the Dead Pixel, "is the audit!"I didn't cast a spell. I didn't verify the syntax. I just jammed the ring directly into the stream of energy flowing from the mages into the Shard.I inserted the Null Variable.The moment the ring touched the energy stream, the world paused.Literally.The sound cut out. The flickering lights froze. The dust motes in the air stopped moving.Buffer Underrun, my mind supplied.The Shard tried to process the new input. It expected pure mana. It got a complex, encrypted, paradoxical Anomaly wrapped in sixteen hours of Entropic alteration. It got a file format it couldn't read.Null_Variable.obj incompatible with Cavaretta_Ritual.exe.The pause lasted for a heartbeat that felt like an hour.Then the crash report arrived.The sound returned not as a noise, but as a shockwave.CRACK.The air shattered.The Shard signaled its distress by inverting the room's gravity. I was thrown upward, slamming into the ceiling—which was now the floor? No, direction was gone."What did you do?!" Marco screamed, his voice distorted, sounding like a digital file played at half speed. "WHAT DID YOU DO?!"The silver-haired mage exploded. She didn't die; she just turned into a cloud of red pixels and vanished. The other two mages collapsed, their bodies twisting into impossible geometries as the Shard tried to source more RAM to process the error."Bianco!" I yelled, searching the chaos.I saw him. He was sliding across the floor—or the wall—falling toward the Shard. The gravity well was dragging him in.No, I thought. Not the kid.My Divinity lunged.It wasn't a choice. It was a reflex. The Blood-black Ouroboros lashed out from my shadow, a tendril of absolute negation. It didn't grab Bianco; that would have crushed him.It struck the space next to him.I deleted the coordinates between Bianco and the door.Pop.Space folded. One second Bianco was falling toward the black hole; the next, he flickered and reappeared at the top of the stairs, outside the ritual boundary. He tumbled onto the landing, safe."Go!" I screamed, though I doubt he could hear me over the roaring of reality tearing itself apart.He looked back once, terrified, and then scrambled up the stairs.Good. Triage complete.Now for the patient.I turned back to the Shard. It was pulsing violently now—Red. Black. Gold. Red. Black. Gold. It was choking on my father.Marco was trying to hold it together. He was pouring his own magic into the circle, shouting command phrases that were dissolving into static. He didn't realize it was over. He was trying to debug a system that was already burning the hardware."It's a bad line of code, Marco!" I shouted, bracing myself against a pillar that was slowly turning into sand. "You can't fix it!"The ritual circle etched into the floor began to peel away, rising into the air like ribbons of burning tape.The "Reality Rendering" of the room was failing. Section by section, the textures were dropping out. The stone wall behind Marco turned into a grey wireframe mesh. The stretcher holding Vincenzo flickered and became a transparent polygon.This isn't magic, I realized with a calm that terrified me. This is simulation theory weaponized.The Shard wasn't just breaking the ritual; it was deleting the save file.Marco finally stopped chanting. He looked at his hands. They were translucent. He could see his own bones, glowing with the golden light of the mana he'd hoarded.He looked at me. For the first time, the arrogance was gone. There was only the confusion of a user who clicked 'Save' and saw 'File Corrupted'."You..." he whispered. "You ruined... everything.""I just balanced the ledger," I said.The Shard let out a sound—a high, piercing shriek that bypassed my ears and vibrated my fillings. It was the sound of a hard drive head crashing into the platter.The Ring—my father—was gone. Absorbed into the black.I felt a hollow ache in my chest where the connection used to be. The weight was gone. The anchor was gone.I lost him, the thought hit me, piercing the adrenaline. I saved the kid, I stopped the monster, but I lost him. Again.There was no time to grieve. The Dead Pixel was expanding. It was no longer heart-sized. It was door-sized. And it was inhaling the room.The noise rose to a frequency that erased thought.A white blindness overtook the edges of my vision. The 'Buffer Underrun' was total. The universe had run out of memory to render the basement of the Cavaretta Estate.I stood my ground, planting my feet on a floor that felt like slush.I looked into the Shard.It wasn't black anymore. It was... waiting.The pressure in the room built. My ears popped. The air was sucked out of my lungs. The pressure was physical, heavier than the ocean, a crushing inevitability.Every instinct in my primate brain screamed: Explosion. Shatter. Duck and cover.I braced myself. I tensed every muscle. I prepared for the glass to break, for the blast wave to liquefy my organs, for the heat to strip the flesh from my bones.The world held its breath.The scream of the Shard climbed higher.
Higher.
Past sound.
Past pain.
Into silence.I waited for the shatter.
I waited for the end.But the glass didn't break.
The world didn't explode.It just... opened.]]></description><link>manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-10-draft.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Projects/Writing/Books/The Cleric Saga/_bmad-output/manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-10-draft.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:17:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[chapter-07-draft]]></title><description><![CDATA[The vending machine let out a final, pathetic wheeze. Inside the glass, the last bag of stale protein chips hung precariously, caught by a single plastic loop that refused to let go. I had put my last two credits into that machine. The coil had spun, groaned, and then jammed.Sold Out.The red LED flickered against my reflection, casting a rhythmic, bloody light over the hollows of my cheeks. I stared at the chips, then at the "Maintenance Required" light. It was a perfect summary of my life: the system had taken my last cent and given me a mechanical middle finger in return. Hunger was a dull, persistent ache in my gut, a reminder that the "White Coat Protocol"—the prestige, the meals, the sleep—wasn't just offline. It was dead. I had mentally erased every logical "Plan B." The loans were maxed. The shifts were gone. The begging had hit a wall of institutional indifference.I looked down the long, dark stretch of the hallway. The only variable left was the one I’d been terrified to touch.Marco Cavaretta.To the hospital, Marco was a malignancy. To the City Watch, he was a Target of Interest. To me, right now, he was a buyer in a seller's market. Working for the Cavaretta family was a death warrant signed in New Jersey dirt, but the risk profile didn't matter anymore. Dinesh Rao was dying in Room 404, and the hospital was already preparing the paperwork to process him into a memory.I wasn't looking for a savior. I was looking for a business partner who knew how to unwrite the rules.I checked the time on my cracked phone. 3:42 AM. The numbers glowed with a cold, blue indifference. I felt the weight of the moral debt I was about to accrue. Cavaretta was a monster, but he was a monster with a checkbook.I turned away from the jammed machine. My boots sounded different now—sharper, heavier. Not the frantic pace of a student, but the steady, grinding rhythm of a man who had stopped running and started hunting for a loophole.I walked toward the double doors at the end of the ward. I could feel the sharp, ionized bite of the night air coming through the vents—the smell of overheated copper and rain. I was no longer a Doctor of the Guild. I was a rogue element in a failing machine. And I was going to find a way to strip the gears.I stood at the threshold of Room 404. The dim light leaking from underneath created a thin, yellowish line across my boots—a boundary between the sterile lie of the hospital and the reality of the tomb.Once I pushed this door open, there was no returning. The ward inside was a graveyard of spent matches, a space where the hiss-click of ventilators provided the only evidence of life in the oppressive gloom. The smell of antiseptic here was failing, overtaken by the faint, sweet scent of biological decay. I took a deep breath. The air filled my lungs with a cold, hollow pressure. I wasn't a hero. I was a son with a desperate gambit.I felt the weight of the gold ring on my finger, a cold circle of grief that felt heavier than the lead blankets the nurses used. A single fluorescent light in the hallway above buzzed with a sudden, sharp intensity, casting a strobe-like shadow across the door. My own heartbeat steadied, synchronized with the rhythmic thrum of the hospital's aging life-support.I pushed the door open. The heavy wood swung inward with a slow, deliberate motion that sounded like the tolling of a bell.I stepped into the dim, machine-filled darkness. The world narrowed down to the figure in the bed and the hiss-click of the machine counting down the seconds."Not yet," I whispered into the shadows. "You don't get to take him yet."I pushed open the heavy, soundproofed door of Room 404, the seal breaking with a pneumatic hiss that sounded like a tomb being unsealed. The weight of it surprised me—solid steel core behind the institutional beige veneer, thick enough to muffle a scream. Beyond the thick glass of the viewport, the storm outside was a muted abstract of violence—rain lashing against the pane like static interference, the thunder reduced to a dull, vibrating bass note that I felt more in my teeth than heard in my ears. I noted the design: the walls weren't built to keep the elements out. They were built to keep the sounds of the dying from reaching the penthouse residents three floors above, where families with proper insurance slept soundly in climate-controlled suites.The storm flickered beyond the glass like a bad transmission, chaotic and distant, while inside, the room was suspended in perpetual fluorescent twilight—a weatherless void where the light never brightened and never faded. There was no window you could actually open, no fresh air, no sense of night or day. Just the eternal, sickly hum of the overhead tubes and the soft percussion of machinery doing the breathing a body should do on its own.I stepped across the threshold, my boots squeaking on the linoleum, leaving wet, muddy prints that the night shift would erase by morning. No one would remember I'd been here by the time the paperwork was processed. On the bedside table, a stasis charm glowed a steady amber—the only thing standing between my father and the void. I recognized the sigil pattern immediately: Tier VIII budget work, the kind of anchor they mass-produced in Shenzhen enchantment factories. Three weeks of stability if you're lucky. Less if the patient's entropy signature is as degraded as his was.I noted the charm's warmth, its soft pulse. That little crystal was doing more work than the entire medical staff combined. It was also the only thing in this room that cared whether Dinesh Rao woke up tomorrow.The first thing that hit me was the sound—the rhythmic hiss-click of the ventilator, a mechanical metronome counting down the end of a legacy. It was the only heartbeat in the room that mattered to the system. I watched my father's chest rise and fall, forced into motion by the machine's insistence, each breath a mandate from the hospital's algorithms rather than an act of living. The air smelled of synthetic lavender—the cheap aerosol kind they buy by the drum—sprayed heavily over something sweeter and wronger. The scent of a body losing its war with entropy, masked but not hidden. Decay, dressed up in floral.I approached the bed slowly, my footsteps loud in the silence. He was still. The coma—or whatever state the hospital coded it as in their billing system—was absolute. I stared at his face, searching for a flicker of the man who had taught me the calculus of load-bearing walls when I was seven, who had drawn suspension bridge diagrams on napkins at dinner, who had spent three decades building the magical infrastructure that the wealthy now took for granted. There was nothing. His features were slack, unresponsive—a face I'd known my entire life, now foreign in its stillness. The lines that used to be laugh lines looked like cracks in old concrete. The stubble on his jaw was gray where it used to be black.I wondered if he was still in there, trapped in some recursive loop of memory—reliving the glory days when he built the support struts for the Golden Gate, the one that powered New Canaan's leyline grid. Or maybe he'd already slipped away, leaving only the biological machinery running on borrowed time and borrowed magic, a shell that persisted because no one had bothered to pull the plug.I let the door swing shut behind me. The latch engaged with a final, metallic clack that echoed off the hard surfaces like a period at the end of a sentence. I didn't reach for the light switch; the monitors bathed the room in their clinical blue glow—enough illumination for a vigil. My objective was simple and impossible: to remain present until the end. To not let him die alone in a room that smelled like lavender and surrender.A cold determination settled into my bones, replacing the bone-deep fatigue with stubborn spite. I pulled the cheap vinyl chair closer to the bed—the kind of chair designed to be uncomfortable enough that visitors wouldn't stay long. The kind of chair that said we'd prefer you to leave. I sat down anyway, the vinyl creaking under my weight, the foam flattening immediately into uselessness.I would sit here, in this sanitized holding cell, and refuse to let my father be processed without a witness.The door hissed open behind me.I turned, expecting crimson armor and enforcement wands—expecting the Regulators to have tracked me here already, to drag me back to some tribunal cell where they could finish cataloging my infractions. Instead, a nurse stood in the threshold, silhouetted against the harsh corridor light. She was middle-aged, with the kind of exhaustion that had settled permanently into the lines around her eyes. Her scrubs were the faded green of institutional budget constraints, washed so many times the color had given up trying. She carried a tablet in one hand and a tray of sealed vials in the other.Her eyes flicked from me to the bed to the stasis charm on the table, performing some internal calculation I couldn't read. Risk assessment. Visitor classification. Probability of making her shift harder than it already was."Visiting hours ended at nine," she said. Not hostile. Just tired. A statement of fact, not an order."I'm aware." I didn't move from the chair. "I'm staying."Silence stretched between us. I could hear the hiss-click of the ventilator marking time, the soft electronic chirp of the heart-rate monitor. She studied me for a long moment—long enough that I started cataloging her features, the way I catalog everything. The wedding ring on her left hand, worn thin. The orthopedic shoes of someone who spent twelve hours on her feet. The slight tremor in her tablet hand that spoke of too much caffeine and not enough sleep.Something in her expression shifted—not quite sympathy, but adjacent to it. The exhausted recognition of someone who had seen this scene play out a hundred times, a thousand times, in rooms exactly like this one."You're his son." It wasn't a question."Bodhi Rao." I nodded toward the bed, toward the still form under the thin sheet. "Dinesh Rao. He was a machinist. Spent thirty-two years working city contracts. Built half the support struts for the harbor gate. Installed the leyline junctions that power half of downtown."She didn't write it down. She already knew it didn't matter to the paperwork. To the billing system, he was a seven-digit ID number and a declining balance. The thirty-two years, the struts, the leylines—none of it converted to credit.But she paused. She looked at my father's face—really looked, the way you look at a person rather than a patient—with an expression that was almost human."The charm," I said, pointing to the amber glow on the table. The warmth of it was visible in the cold room, a tiny island of preserved time in a sea of entropy. "It's a Tier VIII stasis anchor. Budget-tier. That's what you're using to hold him together?"Her jaw tightened. A muscle flickered near her temple. "It's what the plan covers.""How long does it have?"A pause. She was deciding how much honesty I could handle, or maybe how much honesty she could afford to give."The documentation says seventy-two hours." She hesitated. "But documentation and reality don't always agree."I laughed—a short, bitter sound that scraped against the quiet of the room. "Spoken like someone who's been watching this system fail for years."She didn't deny it. She couldn't. Instead, she moved toward the bed with the efficient motions of someone who had performed this routine ten thousand times. She set the vials on the side table—routine monitoring, standard samples, nothing that would actually help—and checked the readings on the stasis charm with a practiced eye. Her tablet beeped soft acknowledgments.As she turned to leave, she paused at the door. Her hand rested on the frame. The corridor light caught the gray threading through her hair."For what it's worth," she said quietly, almost too soft to hear, "I'm sorry it's like this."Then she was gone, and I was alone again with the hum of machines and the soft amber pulse of a charm that was already dying.My gaze dragged from the door back to the bed, from the machines to the man. It caught on the thin, faded hospital gown that hung from his frame like a shroud—white once, now yellowed with age and industrial washing, the pattern of tiny blue flowers almost completely faded away. I reached out, my fingers brushing the rough fabric. Scratchy. Thin. Cold despite the room's warmth.A garment designed to strip its wearer of identity, profession, and history. You put this on, and suddenly you weren't a machinist who'd spent thirty-two years building the city. You weren't a father who drew suspension bridges on napkins. You weren't a man with stories about the Golden Gate and the leyline grid. You were a patient ID and a billing code. A bed number. A declining asset.Dinesh Rao, the master machinist who could calculate load tolerances in his sleep, was gone. In his place lay Subject 881-R—a numbered variable in the hospital's queue, waiting for the system to run its final function.I looked at his hands, resting motionless on the paper sheets. Those hands. God, those hands. They'd welded steel beams, fixed combustion engines, assembled leyline junctions with millimeter precision. They'd built the things that made this city possible, made magic possible for people who'd never learn a single rune. He'd shown me those hands when I was young—the calluses, the old burn scars, the permanent stains from decades of honest labor. These hands built something, he'd said. They built things that'll last longer than I will.Now they just lay there. Still. The calluses fading, the scars smoothing, the hands themselves slowly becoming archival—tagged with a countdown timer, scheduled for disposal.He'd told stories about the Golden Gate project—not the American one, but the New Canaan harbor structure, the massive arch that channeled leyline power from the ocean convergence into the city's grid. He'd worked sixty-hour weeks for three years on that project, coming home with the smell of salt and fibreglass insulation baked into his skin. I remembered him sitting at the kitchen table, his hands shaking slightly from the vibration of the heavy riveting hammer, yet still precision-drawing the next day's tolerances with a charcoal pencil. He'd nearly lost a finger when a containment rune misfired on the primary strut—a flash of violet fire that had fused the safety casing of his lead. He’d just laughed it off, wrapped the burn in a greasy rag, and finished the weld. He'd stood on the observation deck the day they switched it on, his chest swelling as the whole city lit up with power his hands had helped harness. That's legacy, Bodhi, he'd said, the wind whip-cracking his jacket. Magic is just high-rent electricity. These struts are what keep the sky from falling.Those stories felt distant now. Echoes of a different lifetime. The gown had done its job: it had transformed a man into a problem, a legacy into a liability, a life of building into a patient awaiting discharge—one way or another. The master machinist who once calculated the thermal expansion of a ten-thousand-ton bridge was now a biological error message, his history erased by the efficiency of the basement ward.Sorrow rose sharp and sudden from somewhere beneath my sternum, catching me off guard. Not the dull ache I'd been carrying for weeks—this was acute, piercing, like a blade slipping between ribs. My vision blurred, the dim light of the monitors smearing into streaks of blue and orange. A ragged breath hitched in my throat—half-sob, half-gasp—a sound that didn't belong to the clinical, detached persona I'd spent years constructing.I squeezed the fabric of his gown, the rough cotton digging into my palm. Trying to anchor myself to something solid. Something real. The texture of neglect against my skin—that was real. The cold creeping up from the floor—that was real. The faint tremor in my hands—that was real too, even if I didn't want to admit it.I let go. The fabric fell back against his chest with a soft, papery whisper, and he didn't react. Of course he didn't react. He was beyond reaction now, beyond response, locked in whatever twilight state the coma had become.The weight of impending loss settled over my limbs like lead blankets, slowing my movements, fogging my thoughts. Seventy-two hours, the documentation said. Seventy-two hours of watching the stasis charm dim, watching the monitors trend gently toward zero, watching the system perform its final, efficient erasure.No matter what I did in the next seventy-two hours, this moment—this quiet, helpless vigil—might be the only real goodbye I was going to get.I sank into the vinyl chair beside the bed. The foam had given up entirely now, providing no cushion at all, just a thin layer of meaningless material between me and the metal frame beneath. My bones felt hollow. My chest felt hollow. But I was here, and I would stay here, ready to bear the weight of the watch.On the table, the stasis charm pulsed. Still amber. Still holding. For now.I adjusted the chair, pulling it closer to the bed. The metal legs scraped against the linoleum with a sound that set my teeth on edge. The cheap cushion had completely flattened now, providing absolutely no comfort—but comfort wasn't the point. The point was proximity. The point was being here.The room was bathed in the perpetual glow of the monitors, a sickly twilight that the hospital maintained around the clock. No natural light. No sense of time passing. Just the eternal, droning present of life support and institutional efficiency.I reached out and took his hand.The skin was dry, papery—texture of old parchment, of documents that had been stored too long in rooms without climate control. Fragile. I could feel the bones beneath, prominent where they hadn't been a year ago, the flesh shrinking back toward the skeleton it had once concealed. His fingers were cold. The warmth of life was retreating, ceding territory to the chill that waited at the edge of all things.I held on anyway.The mechanical thrum of the life-support systems vibrated through the mattress, up through his arm, into my palm. A synthetic pulse. A machine-made heartbeat. The organic warmth of his actual heart had long since faded to something measurable only by sensors and statistics.I leaned back in the chair, not letting go of his hand, and let my gaze wander the room. Dust motes danced in the blue light of the heart-rate monitor, tiny particles caught in endless orbit, going nowhere. The stasis charm's amber glow reflected off the ceiling tiles, throwing soft shadows across the acoustic panels. The bedsheets under his back weren't real fabric; they were a high-fiber industrial paper, textured like the technical blueprints he used to roll out across the dining table. I remembered the sound of those blueprints—the heavy, crisp crinkle of possibilities. Now, the sound was the same, but the possibilities had been winnowed down to a single, terminal line. Every time he shifted, even slightly, the paper screamed with the sound of a closing ledger.The warmth of the room was fading, I realized. The life-support kept the immediate air circulating, but the ambient temperature was dropping. The stasis charm's bubble of preserved time was shrinking, losing its battle against the encroaching cold.The weight behind my ribs shifted.Not grief—I'd catalogued that already, filed it away where I could deal with it later. This was something else. A warmth that didn't belong to the room. A sensation deep beneath the exhaustion, beneath the sorrow, beneath the cold. Like an ember in a dead fireplace. Like something waking up.And then, unbidden, the memory rose.Not grief. Not the sanitized slideshow of a funeral. Something specific. Something sharp.I was sixteen. Mom's study—or what passed for a study in our apartment, a corner of the living room cordoned off by bookshelves that Dad had built from reclaimed municipal lumber. She sat across from me, a textbook open between us. Standard Primer on Mana Circulation, Second Edition. Academy-approved curriculum.But the notes in the margins weren't standard."The official text will tell you that entropy is a force to be managed," she'd said, her voice low, conspiratorial, like she was sharing a secret that could get us both arrested. (Which, technically, it could.) "They're wrong. Entropy isn't a force. It's a language. And certain families—" she tapped the page, where handwritten symbols curled around the printed text like annotations from a fever dream "—certain families have been speaking it for centuries."The symbols weren't from any tradition taught at Academy. They were older. Angular and organic at the same time, like runes designed by spiders and mathematicians. The script of the Mantravadam—the Hidden Hand tradition of the matrilineal sorcerer clans of Kerala. My mother's people. My people. I had spent years trying to unlearn them, to replace their messy, rhythmic complexity with the sanitized, linear proofs of the Guild. I wanted the clean math. I wanted the Tier I prestige. I wanted to be the doctor who diagnosed with a glance and healed with a gesture, not the one who bartered in the back-alleys of the soul."The Nairs don't heal in the traditional sense, beta." Her finger traced a particularly complex glyph—one that seemed to shiver beneath the skin. "We negotiate. We find the loophole in the contract. The Academy teaches you that entropy is a wall. I'm telling you it's a door. The math, the forbidden math... it's already inside you. It just needs the right catalyst to wake up. It needs you to be desperate enough to stop caring about the rules."I had mocked her then. I was seventeen and full of the arrogance of a fresh Academy admission. Mom, that's just folklore, I'd said. The Guild has peer-reviewed these leylines. We have the data. She’d only smiled, a sad, knowing expression that I hadn't understood until the first time a patient died on my table despite every peer-reviewed protocol I followed. I realized then that the system was built to process the survivors, not to save the lost.I pressed my palm against my sternum again, harder this time. The warmth pulsed once. Twice. Like a heartbeat that didn't belong to me.No. Like a heartbeat that had been waiting for me to finally notice.I looked down at my hands. On my left ring finger, I still wore her wedding band—the plain gold ring I'd pulled from the hospice box they'd handed me after she died. I spun it absently with my thumb, a nervous tick I'd developed somewhere in the haze of the last three years.The metal was cold. It was always cold. A dead circle of grief, worn smooth by repetition.But beneath it, my skin felt warmer than it should.I shook off the distraction. Whatever this was—exhaustion, grief, magical feedback from the failing stasis charm—it could wait. Everything could wait except the next breath, and the next, and the one after that.I stared at his closed eyelids, searching for any flicker of dreaming. Any REM movement behind the paper-thin skin. Any sign that somewhere, deep in the architecture of his mind, Dinesh Rao was still present.Nothing.My clinical armor, my cynical distance—everything I'd carefully constructed over years of watching systems fail and people die and institutions grind human beings into administrative dust—all of it stripped away by the simple act of holding a dying man's hand.I wasn't the radical here. The manifesto felt like theatrical grandstanding, a performance designed for an audience that wasn't in this room. The rhetoric I'd recorded in that warehouse felt absurd now, pointless, words thrown against a machine that didn't care about words.I was just a son.Terrified. Exposed. Watching a heartbeat that was counting down to silence."Dad."The word came out as a whisper, a dry rasp that caught in my throat. I leaned in, my shadow stretching over the paper sheets of the bed, a dark blot against the clinical blue.The ventilator's hiss-click marked time—a second, another second, another. It was a mechanical metronome, steady and cold, the only heartbeat the system recognized. He didn't respond. He hadn't responded in weeks. But I began to speak anyway, the words pouring out into the sterile air like grease from a stripped gearbox."I got kicked out, Dad." My voice was a jagged edge. I cleared my throat, trying to find the clinical distance I’d used as armor for years, but it was dissolving. "The Class IV healing. That girl in the alley. I saved her life, and they expelled me for it. Unlicensed miracle-work. Violation of the Guild statutes. Hartnell himself testified. He looked at me like I was a faulty component, something to be discarded so the rest of the machine could keep humming."I looked at his hands again. I could see the old burn scars from a welding arc that had jumped his lead thirty years ago. I remembered the smell of the shop—rosin, charred dust, and the sharp, metallic tang of hot iron. He used to say that a good machinist didn't just fix a machine; they understood its soul. They heard the subtle change in pitch when a bearing was about to fail."I couldn't hear the failure coming, Dad," I whispered. "Not for myself. Not for you."I spoke of the debt, the words tasting like the copper on my tongue. "The tuition... God, the tuition. You know Mom sold the house for that. And now they want interest on the interest. The Thaumaturgy Credits. They're going to garnish the care account. They’re going to pull the plug on this room because I didn't play by their rules."The ventilator hissed. Hiss-click. A mandate from a system that didn't care about the sixty-hour weeks he’d put into the Golden Gate struts. "I can't practice in New Canaan anymore. I'm blacklisted. Every clinic, every triage station—they’ve all been told I’m a liability. A rogue script." I let out a short, bitter sound that wasn't a laugh. "I’m exactly the kind of problem the bureaucracy was built to solve. A misplaced bolt in the machinery of state."I felt the sudden, sharp spike of heat in my chest again. It wasn't the warmth of a son's love; it was the friction of a machine tearing itself apart. I didn't cry because 'the dam broke.' I cried because the pressure was too much for the casing to hold. Hot streaks ran down my face, dark spots soaking into the bleached fabric of his gown, marking the inequality of a system that traded miracles for credit scores."I wasn't good enough," I said, my voice finally breaking. "I wasn't the doctor you paid for. I wasn't the savior Mom wanted. I’m just a failure in a white coat."I wasn't a revolutionary. I wasn't an architect of some grand new world. I was just a boy at his father's bedside, begging for a miracle from a universe that had already cashed out its budget on the residents of the penthouses upstairs. The weight behind my ribs was absolute. I gripped his hand until my own fingers hurt, trying to feel the pulse that the machine told me was still there. I stayed like that for a long time, the only witness to the slow, efficient erasure of a master machinist.Eventually, my breath steadied. The internal friction slowed, leaving me hollowed out and raw. The grief remained—a dull, systemic ache—but the panic had settled into a cold, heavy layer of spite.I could breathe again. But every breath felt like borrowed time, a series of individual negotiations with a universe that was trying to evict us. I watched the monitors, watching the biological machinery of my father's heart continue its rhythmic, stubborn grind against the dark. He was a machinist to the end, even if the machine was failing.I fixed my gaze on the heart-rate monitor. It bathed the room in a soft, clinical glow—a specific shade of blue I recognized immediately. The same blue the Empire plastered on tax audit notices and euthanasia consent forms. A soothing hue engineered by the Academy’s psychologists to minimize what the documentation called "negative emotional outcomes" among patient families.In other words: a color chosen to help you be polite about dying.The interface was a masterpiece of institutional cowardice. Even the font was a choice—the soulless, rounded curves of an Academy script designed to prevent anxiety. The numbers were large but muted, displayed without context or survival probability. It didn't show the timeline collapsing; it only showed the isolated present. The flatline threshold was a muted, almost cozy maroon, domesticating the end.Death had been rebranded. A "Transition Event." A line item to be processed.I let out a short, humorless snort. The catharsis of the confession had burned away the raw grief, leaving something colder in its place. Clearer. The cynicism was tightening its grip again, the internal gears of my mind settling back into their protective grooves.The blue glow wasn't comfort. It was control. A sedative for the soul, administered without consent. And thinking about it—really thinking about it—the familiar anger ignited in my chest. The cold fire that had fueled my entire career.The Empire didn't just want to kill my father. It wanted me to accept the loss with a minimum of fuss. I stared at my reflection in the blackened glass—ghostly, superimposed over the blue graph. I looked wrecked, hollowed out, but there was a sharp edge in the reflection that hadn't been there an hour ago.I refused the comfort. I wasn't going to be pacified.Hours passed. The storm outside faded to a dull, vibrating bass note against the soundproofed walls. Inside Room 404, the monitor glow became the absolute dictator of reality. Shadows multiplied—skeletal shapes of IV stands and medical equipment morphing against the beige walls with every flicker of the fluorescent tubes.The door hissed open. I flinched, my heart spiking. It was a technician, fresh-faced and nervous, carrying an actual physical clipboard. He worked in silence, recording numbers from the displays, but his eyes kept sliding toward the stasis charm with a practiced, wary calculation."How long does it have?" I asked. My voice sounded like dry parchment.He froze. "The documentation—""I asked how long it actually has."He swallowed, checking the charm's pulse. The amber glow was stuttering, trending toward a sickly, bruised orange. He looked at his tablet, performing the math I already knew."Maybe until morning," he said finally. "Maybe less. I'm sorry."He vanished into the hallway, and the timeline officially collapsed. The "seventy-two hour sentence" had been a lie designed to protect the institution, not inform the family. The actual death would come on its own schedule, dictated by budget-tier magic and entropy curves the Academy never bothered to explain to the residents of the basement wards.On the bedside table, the stasis charm flickered. Once. Twice. A warning pulse. The amber was definitely trending toward orange now. The clock was running. The clock had always been running.And I was running out of time.The stasis charm began to flicker violently, its rhythmic pulse breaking into chaotic flashes. A sharp, grating sound filled the room, less like magic and more like a machine stripping its own gears. The smell of burning ink and hot iron began to creep into the air—the olfactory signature of a Tier VIII anchor failing under a load it was never meant to carry.My entropy wards didn't just tingle—they burned. I looked down at my forearms, at the black bands of protective script. They were pulsing with a deep, strange hue.My Mom's color.Recognition hit me like a bucket of ice water. She hadn't just given me a blessing before I left for the Academy; she’d hidden a dormant code. A second layer of script that only an entropic collapse could trigger. The hidden signature of the Nair family was flickering like a pilot light in an old furnace, ancient and inherited, waiting for this specific terminal second to germinate.Adrenaline hit my blood like a shot of lightning. I stood up, the chair legs screaming against the linoleum, and moved to my father's side. My heart pounded against my ribs in a frantic counterpoint to the binary rhythm of the ventilator. I could feel the "White Coat Protocol"—that internal governor of professional distance and institutional loyalty—finally snapping. It didn't just disintegrate; it failed like a structural weld under too much shear, a clean, violent break that left me untethered.I looked at my arms again. The glyphs were no longer just glowing; they were vibrating, a low-frequency hum that I felt in my marrow. This was the messy negotiation Mom had described—the Hidden Hand reaching out to grasp the slipping gears of reality. The Academy would have called this a "Category 5 Leyline Breach." I called it the only way home.I looked at his face. Peaceful, in the way that patients are peaceful when the biological machinery is running on borrowed time. In minutes, the man who had built half of New Canaan’s infrastructure would be reduced to a storage problem for the hospital’s cremation contractors.My hands hovered over the failing charm. I started the calculation. A manual stasis tether would require three hundred units of mana per second—a drain that would strip the marrow from my bones. I was running a deficit that no Guild-trained cleric could survive. I was effectively trying to outrun an entropy curve that had been accelerating for three decades, a task comparable to holding back a harbor gate with a length of copper wire. But I wasn't just a cleric. I was a machinist's son, and I knew how to over-torque a system until the safety pins sheared off."Not yet," I whispered, the words coming out ragged and sharp, cutting through the static of the failing field. "The machine isn't done with you yet, Dad. And neither am I. We’re going to re-grind these gears. We’re going to force the timeline to hold."I touched the crystal. The world didn't explode; it hummed. A deep, subterranean vibration that spoke of old earth and stolen fire. The white room flickered, the blue glow of the monitors turning a violent, ancient violet. I wasn't managing entropy anymore. I was owning it."Not yet."]]></description><link>manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-07-draft.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Projects/Writing/Books/The Cleric Saga/_bmad-output/manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-07-draft.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:17:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[chapter-06-draft]]></title><description><![CDATA[The door clicked shut, a final, dull thud that severed me from the sterile hum of the hospital corridor. I stood in the dark for a second; the closet silence washed over me. It smelled of the chemical sting of high-pH surface cleaner and old dust—honest, unlike the lavender spray masking the rot outside.I fumbled for the string and pulled. A single, naked bulb buzzed to life. The bulb cast twitching, neurotic shadows across shelves stacked with industrial solvent and mop heads that hung like heavy, graying hair. This was my "Off-Grid Workspace," a tactical node where the hospital's pervasive surveillance wards couldn't penetrate the thick layer of architectural apathy. The Ministry didn't waste mana monitoring the broom closets. They saved the bandwidth for the paying customers.I eased myself onto an overturned plastic bucket, the cold, rigid rim biting into my thighs through my thin slacks. The moment I sat, the adrenaline from the alley fight finally evaporated, leaving nothing but the wreckage essential for the systems check.A wave of nauseating agony hit me with the force of a physical blow. My vision blurred at the edges, the yellowed wallpaper of the closet seeming to pulse in time with the throb behind my eyes. The air felt scrubbed of oxygen as a white-hot spike of pain through my cracked ribs forced a shallow expansion. I hitched, a wet rattle sounding deep in my chest. Damage Control, my mind whispered, slipping instinctively into the clinical detachment of a triage doctor. Assess and stabilize.The metallic ghost of blood filled my saliva—a mineral reminder of the internal damage I had been ignoring for the last hour. My hands trembled as I reached for the hem of my shirt. I pulled it up over my head, the fabric peeling away from the dried blood on my side with a sickening, sticky sound. Internal logistics failed; I retched.I stared down at my torso. I stared at the deep purples and mottled greens spreading across my ribs. Pain wasn't the metric; only the delay mattered. [Administrative Delay] resolved into a single, jagged directive.Lagging Asset, I thought, tracing the edge of the worst bruise with a shaking finger. The heat radiating from the skin felt feverish, like my body was overclocking itself to death.I forced my breathing to slow, counting the seconds between inhalations until the frantic rattling in my chest settled into a dull, rhythmic thrum. I stared at a bottle of floor wax on the shelf opposite me, analyzing the label with uniform focus. I needed to reset. I needed to stabilize before the morning shift began their sweep. Use of unauthorized healing magic in a non-clinical zone was a Class III infraction. Being caught bleeding to death in a janitor's closet was a one-way ticket to the asylum.The hum of the bulb was an off-key B-flat; slightly sharp. A dirty note for a dirty room. Focus, I told myself. You aren't dead yet. Don't let the paperwork file itself.I'd been doing this since Mom died—translating horror into quest text. Clinical distance left my hands steady enough to patch myself.My fingers found the hidden seam in my sleeve—the one I'd sewn myself during a particularly paranoid semester—and retrieved the small glass vial I'd been saving for exactly this kind of catastrophic failure.The salts inside shimmered with a sickly, artificial green, nothing like the warm amber glow of Ministry-approved regeneratives. Black-market goods. "Smuggled Content," as the enforcement briefs called it. A Tier II medical charm the Academy had deprecated three years ago when an intern used it wrong and liquefied her own kneecap. The glass clinked against my thumbnail—a small, sharp sound that felt obscenely loud in the silence of the closet.I uncorked the vial. A faint wisp of scorched-sugar magic wafted out. It caught in my throat and made me cough. The cough sent another spike of agony through my ribs, and I had to grip the edge of the shelf to keep from toppling off the bucket.This is going to hurt. This is going to hurt more than the beating did.I raised my index finger, the skin still stained with grime and dried blood, and traced the Osteo-Knit sigil in the stale air. The magic responded with a reluctant, static-laden hiss—a faint trail of pixelated green light following my movement like a low-resolution graphic struggling to render. A tingle of thaumion depletion prickled my fingertips—a dry, electric sensation that told me the room's ambient mana was dangerously thin. The closet had been built to be invisible to magic. It was also starving for it.The sigil hung there for a heartbeat, flickering and unstable, a broken piece of code waiting to compile. I poured my intent into the shape—heal, knit, bind—willing the messy, entropic energy to cohere into something servicable.Then I slammed my palm into the center of it.The green flare hit my side like a soldering iron kissing bare skin. The magic didn't enter smoothly—it punched through, a pixelated surge of energy that lacked the resolution and grace of high-tier spellwork. I heard the wet, sickening snap-click of bone being forced back into alignment by crude, magical stapling. My own bone. My own meat.Fire raced across my nerves. I clamped my teeth shut to keep from screaming, but a strangled sound escaped anyway—something between a growl and a sob. The entropy-scars on my forearms flared violet. Lines of light traced the old wounds like fault lines. I could feel tiny capillaries rupturing under my skin from the pressure differential, bruises blooming even as the ribs fused.The debt carved itself deeper, I thought, the words surfacing through the haze of pain. Seventy-two hours just became sixty-eight. Maybe sixty-five. The universe charges interest.The smell of singed hair filled my nostrils—my own, burning where the sigil had flared too close to skin. Underneath it, the mineral bite of internal bleeding finally slowing, clotting, surrendering to the crude repair.Then a cold gravity settled in my gut.The sudden, violent restoration of the bone triggered a gag reflex I couldn't suppress. I lurched off the bucket and stumbled to the mop sink, my boots splashing through a puddle of dirty water as I retched into the stained porcelain basin. Nothing came up—I hadn't eaten in eighteen hours—but my body didn't care. It heaved anyway, rejecting the unnatural speed of the knitting flesh.The taste of bitter gall and copper filled my mouth. A physical backwash. The magic's entropic cost, extracted in bile and trembling muscles.I hung over the sink, chest heaving, arms shaking where they gripped the cold porcelain. The green light in the closet slowly faded back into the oppressive shadows. The pain was muted now—replaced by a dull, throbbing ache and the unsettling sensation of bone that had been fused too fast, tissue that had been forced to cooperate.Vertical, operational. Brittle, but the hardware held.Sufficient, my mind echoed. For now.I straightened slowly, testing the repair. My ribs held. The motion didn't trigger the stabbing agony from before—just a stiff, tight pressure, like someone had wrapped my torso in invisible bandages two sizes too small. An ugly patch job. A biological hot-fix that would probably give me arthritis in ten years, if I lived that long.Good enough.I stared at the empty vial in my hand, the glass now clear and lifeless. The salts were gone, consumed by the spell, leaving only a residue of fine, lifeless ash. I ground the vial under my boot, crushing it into the linoleum until it sparkled like the diamond dust in fairy tales—the kind of sparkle that belonged in children's stories, not janitor's closets hiding illegal spellwork.But the repair was only the hardware. The software—my mind, my soul—they kept...they just kept...God...My hands won't stop shaking.I checked my wrist. No watch. I had pawned it three weeks ago for a half-gram of mana-stabilizer that turned out to be sawdust and food coloring. I checked the wall clock, but the hands were frozen at 3:00 AM, likely broken for years. The "Administrative Delay" extended even to the measurement of time in this wing.I needed to move. But first, I needed to verify the integrity of the patch.I twisted my torso, testing the range of motion. The ribs held. No pain, only a stiff, tight sensation where the magic had fused the bone. It felt functional. Brittle, but functional.Acceptable, I thought. Optimization within expected parameters.I reached into my pocket again. This time, my fingers brushed against something cold and metallic. The pager. It sat there like a dormant grenade against my hip. I hadn't looked at it since the ambulance ride last night. I knew it was buzzing—I could feel the phantom vibration against my thigh even when it was still—but I had kept it in "Silent Mode," postponing the reality of the incoming data stream.I pulled it out. The screen was cracked, a spiderweb fracture running diagonally across the LCD display. I pressed the button.The backlight flickered, then stabilized. A single message waited for me.STATUS UPDATE: S. 881-RI stared at the alphanumeric code. Subject 881-R. That was my father. Not Dinesh Rao. Not "Papa." Just a number in a database, a row in a spreadsheet that had been flagged for review. The sanitization of his identity made my stomach clench.I pressed 'Read'.The text scrolled across the small, low-resolution screen in blocky, red letters.TRANSFER AUTHORIZED. 72-HOUR NOTICE. DESTINATION: MUNICIPAL STORAGE.I didn't breathe. I didn't blink. I simply read the words again; I parsed the syntax and analyzed the variables. "Municipal Storage." A polite fiction for the mass graves. The system didn't kill the poor; it stored them. In ash jars.The backwash rose in my throat again, but I swallowed it down. My heart was a high-RPM engine tearing itself loose from the mounts. Inefficient. A "Runtime Error" in a system that couldn't afford a crash.Runtime Error. The label slid off like oil on water.The pager's weight in my hand felt like a stone. Like a verdict. Like the exact moment I'd been running from since Mom's vitals went flat and I stood in a hospital corridor just like this one, twelve years old while the machines fell silent.Papa.The word surfaced before I could stop it. Not "Subject 881-R." Not "the patient." Papa. The man who read me the Mahabharata in bed until I fell asleep. The man who taught me to play chess with pieces he'd carved from soap. The man who was being erased from existence because I couldn't afford to keep him breathing.My hands began to shake. The pager slipped from my fingers and it clattered against the bucket with a crack that sounded like a gunshot in the small room. I lunged for it—stupid, automatic—and the motion sent a fresh spike of pain through my barely-healed ribs.I stopped.I stood there in the dark, breathing like I'd sprinted a marathon, gripping the edge of the mop sink with fingers that wouldn't stay steady. A sound escaped my throat—raw, wet, and too close to a sob for comfort.Stop, I commanded myself. Stop. You don't have time for this.I forced the firewall back up. Made myself pick up the pager. Made myself read the message again, letter by letter, until the words became data instead of a death warrant.72 Hours.I wasn't a doctor looking at a patient's chart. I was a son looking at his father's death warrant. And I had less than three days to do something about it.I gripped the pager until my knuckles turned white. The plastic casing creaked, a sharp snap echoing in the small room as a piece of the housing gave way under the pressure.72 Hours.No Timeline. Just a sentence.I opened my eyes. My workspace was both a refuge and a cage. I stood up, my boots slipping slightly on the wet floor where I had retched. The newly-knit ribs groaned with a dull pressure.I reached for the door handle. It was cold steel, sterile and unyielding.Mandatory Side-Quest. The label floated up automatically, my brain trying to process horror through game mechanics like it always did. But the words felt hollow. This was a countdown to ash.I accepted the terms and the ticking clock. The game was on.I pushed the door open and stepped out into the hallway.I stepped out of the janitor's closet and the world tilted.The transition was violent—from the confined, chemical darkness to the blinding, sterile exposure of the fourth-floor corridor. The fluorescent lights overhead flickered in a staccato rhythm that synced with the throbbing in my ribs. Zzt-click. Zzt-click.I adjusted my jacket, hiding the freshly mended ribs, and tried to orient myself. It should have been simple. Turn left. Walk fifty meters. Elevators.But the hallway didn't look right. It stretched out, elongated and warping like a lens flare, the beige tiles repeating in an infinite, nauseating loop. "Hostile Architecture" wasn't just a theory in a textbook anymore; it was a weapon. No windows. Lights spaced chaotically. Endless sameness—designed to make me feel small. Disoriented. A rat in a maze that had no exit.I stumbled, my shoulder hitting the wall hard enough to send a jolt of pain through my chest.Focus, I commanded. Map the grid.I forced my eyes to track the floor numbers. Room 402. Room 404... No, that was backwards. I spun around. Room 410.My breath hitched. I was turned around. I, who had walked these halls for three years, who knew the quiet spots and the blind corners, was lost in a straight line.The rhythmic hiss-click of distant ventilators echoed down the hall, a mechanical heartbeat that seemed to mock the fragility of the human lives it was sustaining.I forced myself to walk. I kept my head down, staring at the scuff marks on the linoleum. If I looked up, the "Systemic Indifference" baked into the drywall felt heavy enough to crush me. Every flickering light was an eye. Every hum of the air circulation was a whisper.You are not meant to leave.I passed the nurse's station. A pool of brighter light in the dim river. A nurse sat there, typing, the blue glow of the screen illuminating her face. I didn't know her. She didn't look up. To her, I was just a shadow. A "Phase-Shifted" ghost haunting the edges of her shift.I kept moving, my boots silent on the wax. I needed a corner. A shadow. Somewhere to stop shaking.I found an alcove near the freight elevators—a dead zone in the surveillance grid where the cameras had blind spots. I slid down the wall until I hit the cold metal of a bench, the shadows clinging to me like a second skin.I pulled my phone from my pocket. 12% battery. The screen cast a sickly, pale light on my hands. They looked like strangers' hands—bruised, trembling, stained with the grime of the closet.Execute Communication Protocol.I dialed. Sarah Vance. We'd shared coffee, notes, and burnout for two years. She'd covered my shifts when Mom died. She was safe.Ring... Ring...
"Hello?"
Her voice was tight. Guarded.
"Sarah," I whispered. "It's me. I need—" "Bodhi?" The whisper was sharp, panicked. "Oh god. You shouldn't be calling." "I know. I just need a signature. A referral. Anything to delay the transfer. They're moving him in seventy-two hours." "Bodhi? Oh god, stop. You shouldn't be calling. The word in the cafeteria this morning—the Ethics Board is tearing through your files. They’ve already pulled Hartnell in for a 'review.' They aren't just firing you, Bodhi. They're erasing you."
The silence on the line was thick, heavy with fear.
"Sarah, please." "I can't," she breathed. "I have loans, Bodhi. I have a residency. If they see this call..."
Silence. I could hear her breathing on the other end—shallow, ragged, someone drowning in real-time.
"Sarah—" "I'm sorry." The words came out broken, barely audible—a confession, not an apology. I heard her swallow, a dry, clicky sound of someone whose mouth had gone completely dust-dry from fear. Then her voice hardened, the administrative firewall slamming down. "Don't call this number again."
The line went dead before I could respond.I stared at the screen. "Call Ended." The click was an amputation.I tried Dr. Hartnell next. Beep. Beep. Beep. "The number you have reached is no longer in service."I lowered the phone. My ears began to buzz, a high-pitched static that drowned out the hospital hum. I was "Searchable" to the system, but invisible to everyone who'd ever bought me coffee. The "Fuck Magic" manifesto hadn't just made me a hero to the undercity; it had made me a viral contaminant to everyone I knew. The chemical rasp of a high-voltage discharge from the spell-work still lingered in the back of my throat.I felt the weight of the silence in the alcove pressing down on me. I was utterly and completely alone in a city of twelve million souls.I didn't try anyone else. I knew the answer.The link was severed. Clean. Total.I let the phone drop to my lap. Lungs burning, I forced a shallow expansion. The floor wax smelled like a funeral parlor here. A clean, sterile scent that marked the end of my attempt to find a legitimate way out.I sat there for a long time. The "Administrative Closure" was complete. The legitimate paths were closed.I picked up the phone again. 4% battery. A dying ember.I opened the browser. My fingers moved automatically, typing a string of characters that didn't belong in a civilized URL. A backend IP address. A "Black-Mesh" node I'd found years ago and prayed I'd never use.Accessing Repository: Organ_Liquidation_Protocols.The screen flickered. A raw, textual void replaced the clean white of the Ministry web. Green code on black.I wasn't searching for a cure anymore. I was searching for a buyer.The list populated. It was a digital butcher shop.
Kidney (Type O): 4,000 Credits.
Cornea (Pair, unscarred): 2,500 Credits.
Bone Marrow (per liter): 6,000 Credits.
I scrolled. A cold gravity settled in my gut; internal logistics failed as I swallowed back the acid. This wasn't data. This was meat.
Liver Section (regenerative grade): 12,000 Credits.
Heart (In Commission): 45,000 Credits. [Requires certified extraction; mortality rate 100%]
My vision swam. I forced myself to do the math.My kidney: 4,000. My marrow: maybe 6,000. If I strip myself to the frame...I looked at my hands. I imagined them on a tray. I imagined my father's hands on a tray.
New Canaan Hospice Debt: 78,000 Credits.
I let out a sound that was half-laugh, half-sob. Even if I butchered us both, even if I sold every scrap of biological material we possessed, we were insolvent. We were trash.A notification popped up.
WARNING: Unsecured Connection Detected. Tracing... 24%...
The counterspell crawlers.I slammed the phone shut, my hands shaking so hard I almost dropped it. The snap of plastic echoed in the silent alcove like a gunshot.I shoved the device into my pocket, my heart hammering against my ribs. I felt cold. Freezing. Converting human life into credits wasn't just illegal; it was damning. I had looked at my father and seen inventory.I stood up, swaying slightly. I had to get out of the alcove.A janitor passed me in the corridor—older, gray-haired, pushing a mop bucket that squeaked. He glanced up. Didn't speak. But for just a second, he saw me. Not a viral contaminant. Not a rogue asset. Just a kid shaking apart in a hallway.He nodded once. A small, tight gesture of solidarity. Then he was gone.I watched him go. The nod anchored me. It reminded me that there was a world beneath the clean, sterile lies of the hospital.And in that world, there was one name left.Marco Cavaretta.The Cavaretta Club. The speakeasy in the textile district.A suicide note, not a lifeline. But at this point, the distinction was academic.I wasn't ready to sign the suicide note just yet. I had to verify the legitimate path was closed—completely, irrevocably closed.Billing was three floors down and across the atrium—close enough to hear the intake lobby's chaos, far enough to pretend it wasn't happening. The department was a glass-walled enclosure in the center of the floor, designed to look transparent but built to be impenetrable.Inside sat Mrs. Gable. I'd dealt with her before, during Mom's final weeks. She wasn't human; she was a "Firewall with a Perm"—that's what the residents called her, anyway. She had sat at that desk for twenty years, denying coverage with the same flat, bored affect she used to order lunch.A small photograph sat on her desk, slightly faded: two children in soccer uniforms, grinning at the camera. Grandchildren, probably. The frame was cheap plastic, the kind you got at a dollar store, but she'd placed it where she could see it while she worked. Where she could glance at it between rejections.I approached the sliding glass window. It was closed. I knocked on the glass, a sharp, insistent rap that hurt my bruised knuckles.Mrs. Gable didn't look up. She was typing. Her fingers attacked the keyboard with percussive violence. Clack-clack-clack-ENTER. Another claim denied. Another life rounded down to zero.
"Mrs. Gable, about Subject 881-R—" "Visiting hours are concluded," she said, her voice as flat as a PDF. Clack-clack-clack-ENTER. "Outstanding balance on your 02:00 AM admission remains unpaid. I cannot open the file for 881-R while your own account is in arrears." "It's my father. He's being stored—" "He is being transferred to Municipal Storage," she corrected, finally looking at me with the eyes of someone who had seen a thousand fathers become ash. "Protocol for non-payment is non-negotiable. We have... obligations."
She didn't say 'shareholders.' She didn't need to. The word hung in the air anyway.
"I can pay," I lied. The words tasted like bile.
Mrs. Gable put her glasses back on. She tapped a few keys, checking the ledger of my failures. "Your credit score is 412. Your assets are frozen pending the tribunal hearing. And..." she squinted at the screen, and I swore I saw her wince. "You are currently listed as 'Unemployed/High Risk.' You couldn't secure a loan for a sandwich, let alone a Level 4 Hospice Transfer."
"I have skills," I said, my voice rising. Desperation was cracking my calm. I leaned in close to the speaking slot; I breathed the stale, recycled air of the lobby into her sanctum. "I'm a Class IV Healer. I was a Doctor of the Guild. Twelve hours ago. Now I'm Persona Non Grata in a hospital I used to call mine—but I can still work. Put me on the graveyard shift. I'll scrub the bedpans. I'll triage the overdose cases in the waiting room. Just... delay the transfer."
Mrs. Gable looked at me then. Really looked at me. For a second, I saw something human behind the lenses—not pity, not disgust, but something worse. Something like understanding. Like she'd seen this exact scene play out a thousand times and knew exactly how it would end.Her gaze flicked to the photograph of her grandchildren. Then back to me.She didn't look at me. She acknowledged the photograph for a microsecond—her internal validation check—before she brought the stamp down.
"For what it's worth, Mr. Rao…I'm sorry it has to be this way." Her voice caught in her throat midway through the sentence. THUD.Or maybe I had just imagined it. REJECTED. The red ink looked like blood.
"Next," she said, looking past me to the empty lobby. Her voice was flat again. Professional. The glimpse of humanity sealed back behind the glass.
I stood there for a long moment, my breath fogging the window. I had thrown my pride on the counter, and she had filed it under 'Insufficient Assets'.The horror lay in her lack of malice; she was just doing her job, a small, functioning cog in a machine that never stopped eating—and somewhere in her, she knew it.I turned and walked away. The sound of her typing followed me, relentless as a heartbeat.I stopped in front of a flickering vending machine in the hallway. The dark, polished glass acted as a crude mirror, reflecting the wreckage of the night.I saw myself for the first time since the fight: my face was a mask of dried blood and deep, purple contusions, my eyes hollowed out by exhaustion and fear. I looked like a ghost haunting my own life, a "Subject" that the world had already begun to discard.I leaned in closer. The low-frequency hum of the machine vibrated through the glass and into my forehead, a steady, mechanical pulse that grounded me in the cold reality of failure.I stared through my own reflection, and for a terrifying second, I didn't see myself. I saw my father. The same sharp angles of the jaw, the same weary set of the shoulders. I looked like a man who had been "Depreciated" by the system. A "Legacy Asset" running on expired code.I am becoming him. The loop is closing.The coil had turned, but the bag hadn't dropped. It was the perfect microcosm of the City. You paid. You followed the prompt. The machine ate your credit anyway. The loop wasn't just closing; it was strangling me.I felt a sudden, sharp surge of heat in my chest—a spark of entropic energy that burned through the cold fog of my despair. My hands curled into fists, the knuckles turning white against the dark glass.The flickering red "Sold Out" sign reflected in my eyes looked like a spark of fire.I pulled my forehead away from the glass. The cold spot on my skin vanished, replaced by a feverish heat. I stared directly into my own eyes, no longer finding a victim. There was no more room for the system's rules or the Guild's ethics. If the architecture was built to keep me out, I'd find the fault lines and tear it open.If the legitimate paths were closed, I would build a new one out of the wreckage.
"Fine," I whispered to the reflection. The voice wasn't a rasp anymore. It was a command. "We do it the hard way."
My phone buzzed against my hip. A death rattle vibration. 2% battery. A priority override notification pulsed through my cracked display, bypassing every firewall I'd built.The vending machine's fluorescent tube stuttered. My reflection fractured into strobe-light ghosts.No sender ID. No number. Just a sigil rendered in bleeding pixels: the Cavaretta crest.The crest brought it all back. Eighteen months collapsed into a single, sour taste at the back of my throat.The Cavaretta Famiglia. Calabrian blood, old money, and a network that stretched from Naples to New Canaan. They'd never produced a single mage in their entire lineage—a fact that burned Marco Cavaretta like acid—but what they lacked in magical talent, they compensated for in leverage. Financial reach. Political muscle. The kind of pull that could bend the rules governing who deserved care and who deserved to rot.I'd first walked into their offices sixteen months ago. Desperate. Stupid. My father's diagnosis had been accelerating for years, but the final prognosis hit like a hammer wrapped in legal documents: Terminal cognitive decline. Six months without intervention. Eighteen with standard Mundane palliative care.Standard Mundane care. As if Dinesh Rao were just another failing body in a failing system.He'd spent thirty years as a civil engineer. Built bridges. Designed infrastructure. And when the Federation decided New Canaan needed power that didn't rely on coal or nuclear, my father had been the one to oversee the installation of the Artificial Ley Lines that now hummed beneath every hospital, every Academy building, every magical institution in the city.Dinesh Rao had literally wired the magical grid that kept New Canaan alive.But when his mind started to go? When the plaques and tangles began chewing through the neurons that remembered my mother's face, my childhood, the lyrics to stupid Bollywood songs he used to sing while making chapati?The Ministry told him to apply through standard channels. The Academy's Ethics Board reviewed his case and concluded that—despite his "proximity to magical infrastructure"—he remained a Mundane. Ineligible for in-patient magical care. The Ley Lines he'd installed could heal a hundred mages a day, but they couldn't spare a single joule for the man who'd put them there.That was the system. Clean. Efficient. Brutally logical.Marco Cavaretta had offered an alternative."We have pull, Dr. Rao...sorry, mister Rao," he'd said, sitting across from me in a leather chair that probably cost more than my annual salary. "The Federation owes us favors. The Hospice Director owes us more. Your father will receive Class III Magical Care—the finest available to any mundane in North America. And in exchange..."In exchange, I became the Cavaretta Family physician.The deal seemed almost fair, at first. My unique skillset—the Entropic Manipulation techniques I'd inherited from my mother's research, the oversized magical circuits I'd been born with, the scalpel-precision I'd honed through years of obsessive practice—all of it made me one of the few Clerics in the Western Hemisphere capable of performing Class IV healing without a support team.I could do the work of five healers, working alone. Marco needed that.Don Vincenzo Cavaretta, his father, had been dying for years. A magical wasting disease that no amount of mundane medicine could touch and no ordinary Cleric could reverse. I became his personal life-support system. Every week, I'd make the drive to the Cavaretta estate. Every week, I'd pour my mana into the old man's collapsing body, buying him another seven days.Every week, the interest on my debt grew.Marco had structured the loan like a predatory mortgage. Variable rates tied to my "performance metrics." Bonus penalties for any decline in Vincenzo's condition—as if I could outrun entropy itself. Compounding interest that made the original sum feel like a rounding error.I'd started working for the Cavarettas to save my father.Sixteen months later, I owed them more than I'd ever be able to repay.Of course. Marco had been circling for weeks. Breadcrumbs in my voicemail, "opportunities" slipped through intermediaries. I'd ignored every one. The universe had a sick sense of timing.I tapped the screen.Raw video feed. Uncompressed. Marble floors, medical equipment worth more than my father's entire care plan, a bed like a sarcophagus.Don Vincenzo Cavaretta lay in the center, comatose. His chest rose and fell with mechanical rhythm—a man whose body hadn't received the death memo. On his chest, resting like a tumor made of light, sat a sliver of something old.The Shard.I'd heard whispers about objects like this—fragments of power that didn't obey natural physics. "Calcified mana," the black-market dealers called them. A lie for people who didn't want to know they were holding pieces of reality's source code. The Shard pulsed with an entropic frequency that registered in the Class I range—Creation, Destruction, the kind of power that rewrote history. Marco was holding a fragment of the most powerful magical artifact in the world, and he had no idea he was playing with a nuclear warhead.Digital ghosts crawled across the pixels. Tengura semagrams—a language older than the Academy—flickered in the distortion.WE SEE YOU TOO, HEALER.Marco's voice cut through, smooth as oil on water. "We're both out of time, Bodhi," Marco said, his voice stripped of its usual mob-boss polish. "Fix my father or lose yours. Take the job, and the Cavaretta Famiglia no longer owns a single breath of your father's life."
The video feed cut. My phone's screen died with a pathetic whimper. 1% battery.I stared at the dark glass of the vending machine. My reflection stared back—hollow, battered, calculating.The Cavarettas had put my father in this bed. Their "pull" got him admitted when the Ministry would have left him to rot. Their interest rates bled me dry ever since. Working for Marco meant walking into the den of the monster that had been slowly digesting my family for years.And Marco's jealousy made everything worse. He'd spent his entire life watching others wield the power he could only purchase. His own son, Bianco, represented everything Marco craved and would never possess—a natural sorcerer, born with an Innate Personal Magic the catalogues called "The Domain of Fear." Even worse, Don Vincenzo had been grooming Bianco as his successor. The old man saw his grandson's magical talent as the key to elevating the Cavaretta Famiglia from mere brokers to true power players.Marco was being bypassed. His own father preferred the grandson over the son.That kind of resentment didn't stay contained. It leaked into every deal, every negotiation, every predatory interest rate adjustment. Marco didn't just want Vincenzo saved—he wanted to prove that he was the one who made it happen. That his connections, his resources, his dealings brought the Famiglia back from the brink.I was a tool in Marco's succession war. Nothing more.But the Shard could remove my physical limiter. And a Class V ritual could do more than just restore a comatose mobster.The variables aligned into a single, jagged intent. Sharp. Dangerous. Entirely my own.The ritual architecture had gaps. Missing anchors that Marco couldn't provide and didn't understand. But I understood. I'd spent years working with my mother's research on soul-binding and entropic inversion. I knew where those gaps were—and I knew what could fill them.Mom's ring sat heavy in my pocket. A piece of her, condensed into a loop of gold.The ring could act as a soul-anchor. Imperfect, improvised, but adequate. A tether binding a fragment of Dinesh Rao's consciousness to a physical object—exactly the kind of component Marco's ritual was missing.If I slipped it into the ritual circle, no one would notice. Marco didn't understand the technical architecture. Bianco was still learning the basics. The Shard's overwhelming power would mask the additional variable.And when the Class V inversion peaked, I could redirect the flow. Use the Stone's raw processing power to run two resurrection threads instead of one. Vincenzo would get his revival—Marco would get his trophy. But the same reality-patch would also restore Dinesh Rao. Two resurrections for the price of one betrayal.The math worked. Barely. The Shard had enough power left to fuel both operations if I timed the execution correctly. One distributed computing job split across two targets.I'd be stealing processing power from a Divine Artifact that the entire magical world had been denied for nineteen centuries—an artifact hoarded by emperors and cardinals while people like my father died waiting for care they were told they didn't deserve.The system had failed him. The system had failed us both.If the people who controlled the Stone refused to use it for its intended purpose, then maybe it was time someone else did.My mother would have called me reckless. The Academy would have called me a criminal. The Federation would have called me a traitor to everything medical ethics stood for.But my mother was dead. The Academy had classified her research as "unstable" and buried it. And the Federation had already decided that Dinesh Rao didn't deserve to live.I'd spent sixteen months following the rules. Paying the interest. Performing the weekly healings. Playing the good contract worker.The rules had lived me dry.I slipped the dead phone into my pocket. The "hard way" had just become specific.]]></description><link>manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-06-draft.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Projects/Writing/Books/The Cleric Saga/_bmad-output/manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-06-draft.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:17:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[chapter-05-draft]]></title><description><![CDATA[The New Canaan Hospice waiting room was a masterpiece of beige bureaucracy. Designed to induce immediate submission. Overhead, fluorescent tubes hummed at a "headache-yellow" frequency, vibrating against my optic nerves, while the air scrubbers pumped out a scent that was equal parts stale coffee and rain on hot asphalt—the perfume of dying in a room that charges by the hour. A cooling unit near the reception desk clicked with a violent, irregular thrum-click that mimicked a failing heart. It punctuated the silence of my own poverty.I flinched at the sound, my body betraying the exhaustion I'd been trying to plaster over with a mask of stoicism. My stomach clenched. It was a knot of acid and bile that hadn't seen real food in twenty hours. I tasted the sharp, metallic tang of blood where I'd bitten my tongue during the intake interview. My fingers crumpled the edge of the paper in my hand, the thermal texture slick and cheap against my sweating palm.Stop it. I forced my hand to smooth the notice back out. You can't fight the enemy if you can't read the fine print. I raised the notice to eye level, dissecting the document like it was a cadaver in anatomy lab. I traced the header—Account Arrears Summary—and the bolded deadline, calculating the minutes until my father became a municipal statistic. My eyes tore through the fine print, hunting—for a loophole, a typo, a statute citation I could weaponize.The font was serif—Cambria or Times New Roman. Formal. Polite. Lethal. It's always a serif when they're killing you, I thought. It insulated the administrators who signed these warrants. "Municipal Storage" was the polite fiction they used for the mass graves in the Exclusion Zone. A trick that turned a corpse into "inventory." This wasn't medical care; it was a supply chain issue, and my father had been flagged as expired stock.
"Excuse me," I said, my voice a scrap of broken glass.
"There's a procedural desync in the discharge billing. Chronal markers aren't valid until countersigned." A lie. A desperate technical fabrication. I delivered it anyway, wearing the ghost of a white coat I no longer owned.The Administrator finally looked at me. Her eyes slid over my ruined suit and unkempt hair with the practiced dismissal of someone cataloguing garbage. She tapped a single key—Enter—and the printer behind her spit out a confirmation slip.
"The queue automated physician sign-off at 0800 hours, Mr. Rao," she said, not looking up. "The transfer is immutable. System-level protocol. There is no desync."
She placed the Transfer Confirmation on the counter. The sheet landed with a soft, final slap. A gavel made of paper.I stared at the white paper glaring under the harsh lights. No human being left to negotiate with. Only algorithms executing orders. I couldn't pay the arrears (Insolvency). I couldn't hack the municipal grid without my academy credentials (Access Denied). I couldn't punch a server rack (Futility—also, assault charges).A perfect, silent punchline.I backed away from the counter, eyes darting around the lobby for any other option. They landed on the Holographic Loan Kiosk in the corner. A predator trap for the desperate. A digital shark smiling with 400% APR teeth. The only door left open.The Loan Kiosk squatted in the corner of the lobby, a slab of off-white plastic that had been bleached by too many rounds of hospital-grade disinfectant. It hummed with the high-pitched, tooth-aching frequency of a device that never slept. Stained with the ghost of a thousand desperate palm-prints, it was a shrine to the commodified soul.The screen chirped a cheerful, synthetic major-key melody. A simplified, wide-eyed cartoon fox wearing a stethoscope—Dr. Penny-Wise—flickered to life. Its pixelated tail wagged in a rhythmic, hypnotic loop.
"Good morning, Neighbor!" the kiosk chirped, the fox's voice a syrup of artificial empathy. "I see a lot of stress in your bio-markers! Would you like to access some 'Neighbor-Help' Liquid Assets? We're dedicated to bridging the gap between your health and your bill!"
I stepped into the proximity field. The machine’s camera lens, a tiny black eye nestled in the plastic, whirred as it tracked my movement. The air smelled of burnt dust and warm, scorched plastic—the scent of a processor working overtime to strip-mine the poor.
"Account 88-Delta," I said, my voice barely a whisper against the hum. "Entropic stabilization for C. Rao. Seventy-two hour bridge."
The fox’s ears perked up. "Processing... Oh dear! It looks like your traditional fiat-credit has suffered a total-system collapse. But don't worry! At Neighbor-Help, we know that you are your greatest asset. Would you like to review our Vitality-Lien options?"
Biological collateral. The polite term for carving out pieces of your future to pay for the present.
"Give me the numbers," I rasped. "For a seventy-two hour stabilization, we're looking at a standard Causal Excise. Five percent of your peak-metabolic window, to be harvested during your chronological fiftieth year. Plus a minor neurological 'sampling' of your long-term creative memories for our demographic-enrichment training sets. Shall we begin the harvest?"
Five percent of fifty. The years when I’d finally be able to breathe. And the memories—they didn't just want my labor; they wanted my childhood as training data for an algorithm designed to replace me.I laid my hand on the scanner bed. It wasn't glass. It was a mesh of micro-needles and thermal sensors. It latched.
A sudden, jarring suction that felt like it was trying to pull the marrow right through my pores. My vision swam with static. A fleeting image of my seventh birthday flashed: the smell of the ocean, the wooden boat's weight—then grayed out, like a file being deleted in real-time. A sharp, electric sting. The machine shuddered, a satisfying ka-chunk of gears deep inside its guts. "Alert: Biological Yield Insufficient," the fox said, its voice losing its warmth. The tail stopped wagging. "Causal data-density too low. Applicant age-to-yield ratio is 'Sub-Optimal.' Transaction Denied. Action: Refund of harvested data is unavailable due to file corruption. Have a nice day!"
It didn't just reject me. It stole from me and then called me garbage. Typical. I should have known—the last time I signed a contract that promised 'futures' for 'service', it had landed me in the mud for four years. The Tuition Assistance was supposed to be the discharge, not a prelude to another 'enlistment'.I laughed—wet, broken, scraping my throat raw. The machine was polite because it didn't need to be violent. The math did the violence for it. I turned my back on the pixelated fox. I had to escape this administrative violence before I screamed or broke something.I retreated into the alcove of a row of vending machines, a narrow Purgatory of buzzing coils and stale air. Above me, a fluorescent tube was dying. It flickered in a rhythmic, violent pulse of "Bruise-Purple"—a color that felt like a physical throb against my eyeballs. Strobe... dark... strobe... dark...The air smelled of warm, scorched plastic and the cloying, fake-cherry scent of generic soda syrup. It was thick. Too thick to actually inhale.I fumbled for the receipts in my pocket. My hands weren't just shaking; they felt like they were vibrating at a different frequency than the rest of my body. These weren't just paper; they were indices of failure, thermal-printed anchors dragging me into the gray slush.Hospice Entry: $1,200 (Non-Refundable). Causal Audit: $450. Parking (Zone 4): $80.Eighty dollars for the privilege of waiting for a man to die. The irony was a physical weight on my solar plexus, a crushing gravity that made the floor feel like it was tilting at a forty-five-degree angle.My heart was galloping, a frantic, trapped animal in a ribcage that was suddenly three sizes too small. I tried to swallow, but my throat had turned to sandpaper. The sound of the fluorescent light—a high-pitched skreeeee—grew until it was the only thing I could hear.I'm dying, I thought. The medical student in me tried to run the diagnostic—tachycardia, hyperventilation, acute adrenergic surge—but the student was drowning in the noise.A Billing Administrator walked past the alcove. She was a blur of crisp white poly-blend and the scent of expensive toner. I reached out, my fingers brushing the air where her sleeve had been. "Wait," I tried to say. It came out as a wet, pathetic wheeze. She didn't even turn her head. Her heels clicked away—clack, clack, clack—the sound of a system that functioned perfectly as long as you weren't an error code. I wasn't a man to her. I wasn't even a patient. I was a negative balance. To the system, I was insolvent; therefore, to its agents, I was invisible.The purple light flared once, blindingly bright, and then died with a final, pathetic pop. I was left in the semi-darkness. The silence was worse. It was the sound of my father's lungs failing in a room three floors up, and there was nothing—not a single credit, not a single drop of childhood memory—that I could do to stop it. I slumped against the side of a 'Protein-Plus' dispenser. The cold metal was the only thing keeping me from dissolving into the floor wax. Panic rose in my throat, hot and acrid. I needed air. I needed to not be here.The alley behind the hospice was a monochrome canyon of wet concrete and overflowing dumpsters. It was snowing—heavy, wet flakes that tumbled from the gray sky like torn clumps of cotton. They sizzled faintly as they hit the trash-smeared pavement, dissolving instantly into the toxic slush that coated New Canaan like a second skin.The air here bit. It tasted of wet ash and diesel, rotting vegetables, and the metallic tang of unscrubbed atmospheric soot—the flavor of the city when it thinks no one is tasting it.I pushed away from the heavy steel door, letting it click shut behind me. I needed distance. I needed the cold to numb the panic radiating from my chest. I fumbled for my pack of cigarettes—cheap "Synthi-Slims" that burned too fast and tasted like tire rubber—and lit one with shaking hands. The flare of the lighter momentarily illuminated the grime on the dumpsters: layers of graffiti and grime that looked like geological strata of urban decay.I dragged deep, the harsh smoke scouring my lungs, grounding me in the present moment. I tilted my head back, letting the snow melt on my face.Low-res precipitation, I thought, the analytical loops of my training failing to disengage. The particle physics are lazy. Uniform trajectory. No drift.I deconstructed reality to keep it at arm's length. I wondered if the snow was even real, or just another layer of the municipal illusion designed to hide the dirt. If I looked close enough, would I see the pixels?Crunch.The sound cut through the ambient hum of the city like a gunshot. A heavy, deliberate step on gravel.My brain categorized it: Expensive sound. Heavy leather sole. High density rubber heel. Not the cheap, slapping tread of synthetic sneakers.I froze, the cigarette halfway to my mouth. My gut went still—the kind of stillness that comes before an ambush, a half-remembered instinct from briefings I wasn't supposed to remember. The silence that followed was too heavy. Suffocating.The alley wasn’t empty. Not a sanctuary. A kill box.I turned, calculating the vectors of escape. A lock secured the back door from the outside—standard security protocol. The alley mouth was fifty yards of slippery, uneven terrain. I stood cornered in a dead-end of my own making.I didn't run. Running implies guilt. Worse, it triggers a predator's prey drive.I dropped the cigarette into the slush, the embers hissing as they died. I turned to face the darkness at the end of the alley, forcing my posture to straighten. I swapped my "Exhausted Student" persona for something harder, sharper. Armor I hadn't worn in years.Three shadows detached themselves from the darkness at the mouth of the alley. Shadows I recognized.The Jims.That’s what I called them. I wasn’t interested in giving Marco’s muscle generic mobster monikers like ‘Tony’ or ‘Fredo.’ If I'm being frank (not 'Jim', HA!), I was never entirely sure I wasn’t meeting the same three men every time. They seemed grown from identical vats of high-grade protein and low-grade empathy, processed into matching, wool-coated walls of professional violence. Marco liked his assets modular; if a Jim got his head taken off by a backfiring ward, another one with the same haircut and blank stare would be out for coffee ten minutes later.Soldati of the Cavaretta Famiglia. Combat Mages. Professional Hitmen.Oh, piss my ass in half. Was there a text thread to coordinate collecting on my debts today?The first thing I noticed wasn't their size. It was the taste of the air around them. A sharp, singing scent like violin rosin—the Trioxygenic-residue of active, primed spell-work. My entropy wards prickled in warning. These weren't street-thugs; they were processors.They moved in a staggered triangle formation, each step synchronized with military precision. The Jim on point—Kinetic Knuckles—had glyphs crawling across his knuckles that flared a dull, predatory red. The second Jim hung back, fingers tracing lazy patterns in the air—Vector Convergence. The third, the Suppression Jim, was the scariest: he wasn't doing anything visible, but I could smell the chalk-and-sulfur stench of a prepared alchemical dampening array.Shit.I ran the probability calculus in my head, the numbers tumbling like dice.One-on-one against a Jim? 50/50, maybe. I'd clocked faster problems in deeper mud. Against two of them? 15-20% odds—still a gamble I might take if I were desperate. But three? Three trained mage-enforcers working in coordinated formation?Less than 3%.The lead Jim lifted his left wrist. A high-fidelity holo-emitter sparked to life, cutting through the falling snow like a welding-arc.A small, shivering hologram of Marco Cavaretta materialized. He was holding a flute of champagne, the background noise of a gala—expensive laughter and chamber music—buzzing through the transmission. Marco looked great. He always looked great. The sleek, tailored cut of his suit and the practiced shine of his hair screamed "Old Money," even if the blood under his fingernails was still fresh.
"Bodhi," Marco's voice said, crisp and terrifyingly casual. "You're late. Again." "Marco," I said, squinting at the blue ghost. "You've got a voice that goes up one side of me and down the fucking other. The hair plugs are keeping, I take it?"
The hologram flickered as Marco laughed. It was a digital, hollow sound.
"Humor is a poor hedge against insolvency, Bodhi," he said, taking a sip of his virtual champagne. "Your father’s hospice bill hit the arrears limit at 0900. The hospice admin sent the transfer notice, didn't they? Municipal storage for old Dinesh. A cold end for a man who built the very Ley Lines this city uses to bleed its citizens dry."
I felt the anger flare—hot and acrid, burning through the exhaustion. "Don't talk about my father," I spat. "I’m talking about assets, Bodhi. Dinesh Rao was a brilliant engineer. He built the veins of New Canaan. It’s only poetic that the family he served should eventually... own the blood in his. But my father—Don Vincenzo—he’s a traditionalist. He has a certain sentimentality for your mother’s research into Entropic Manipulation."
Marco leaned in, his holographic face enlarging. Between his fingers, he held a tiny, glowing object. A sliver of something that looked like calcified violet light.
"The Shard," he whispered. "Vatican-grade mana. I’m offering a trade. Perform a Class V Sub-Resurrection on my father using this sliver as your anchor. A Causal Inversion of his failing vitals. Do that, and your father’s debt is cleared. Permanently. He stays in comfort. You get your license back."
I stared at the glowing sliver in the hologram. My stomach did a slow, sickening roll. A Class V? That wasn't just healing; that was violating the conservation of soul-data. It was a technical impossibility without a massive sacrifice.
"Men in positions of bargaining aren't usually in the habit of sending Three-Man Candygrams to communicate terms, Marco." I bit out before I could stop myself. Ohhhh, bad. Very bad. Bite your tongue, dude. BITE IT!. "You didn't think I'd send mundanes after a cleric, did you?" Marco said, with a thin, pitying smile. "The deal is non-negotiable. I'm authorizing the Jims to provide... a gentle reminder of the urgency."
I stepped back, my heel hitting the rusted flank of a dumpster.My tenure under Marco painted a vivid image of where this was going. Oh well. Might as well set the tone. "You've been a real twat since you got good hair, Marco..."
The hologram snapped off. The silence returned, filled with the static pressure of violence and the acrid bite of primed spell-work.I raised my hands. Not in surrender. In the shaky guard of a man who knew he was about to be processed.My brain, starved of options, did the unthinkable: it started playing music. Not real music—a hallucination of adrenaline and sleep deprivation. A stadium-announcer voice echoed in the hollow of my skull, absurdly sincere.Who is freezing cold, with the strength of a hati? (BODHI!)
Who uses the microwave to warm up his mom's chapathi? (BODHI!)
Who is sick of eating pizza every night? (BODHI!)
Who is going to lose a fight to prove that Amma was right? (BODHI!)I barked a laugh that died before it formed. The absurdity of it was a pressure valve, a psychological circuit-breaker before the fuse blew.
"Fine then,"
I ground out, the words escaping before the fear could choke them.
"Three-on-one? Somebody play my theme music, it's time to throw our lives away, boys! I hate you, bhenchod, let's die!"
The movement was so efficient it registered as violence. Kinetic Knuckles stepped in—no telegram, just a sudden encroachment of my personal space—and I felt the air compress around his fist. The kinetic amplification runes across his knuckles flared cherry-red.I threw up a ward. Instinct. My left hand snapped up, fingers rigid, thumb bent inward. Pataka. The Flag. A banner of kinetic resistance unfolding in the space between us. The glyph blazed to life in the air—a hasty Kinetic shield that should have eaten the momentum of his punch and scattered it into thermal noise.It didn't.His fist punched through my ward like it was tissue paper. The glyph shattered into a shower of violet sparks, and the impact kissed my ribs with the force of a wrecking ball. I staggered, the breath exploding from my lungs.Bad math. Very bad math.I sidestepped the follow-up strike, the motion more instinct than training. The blow whistled past my ear, and I felt the displaced air tug at my hair like a jealous lover.
"Tough day at the barnyard then, eh Jim?" I spat, my heart hammering against my ribs. "Which one of you is the animal wrangler? Can we put that thing back in it's pen before it poops on something?"
They didn't laugh.I didn't wait for the second move. I lunged. Not at Kinetic Knuckles—at the Vector mage. Disrupt the formation. Break the geometry.
I chambered my right hand, curling the fingers tight, thumb locking the index. Mūṣṭi. The Vajra Fist. I throw a punch and cast at once. My knuckles connected with his jaw, and the mudra multiplied the vector. The air distorted—a spatial lag, a double-shock of force that cracked bone like porcelain.For a microsecond, the fear vanished. Something older took its place—not dark, not ancient, just sharp. The world narrowed to angles and openings. The crazed smile found my lips before I could stop it. I knew that smile. I hated that smile.Vector Jim staggered back, his jaw already swelling. Then he spat blood and smiled back.His fingers twitched, and the world went sideways. Not metaphorically—literally. The Vector Convergence field activated, and suddenly my forward momentum was redirected ninety degrees to the left. I stumbled, the geometry of my own movement betraying me.He wasn't taking the hit—he let me commit to the motion so he could bend it.Before I could recover, Kinetic Knuckles was on me. A jackhammer blow caught my side—amplified, compounded—and I felt a rib crack with a sound like a green branch snapping. The pain was a white flower blooming behind my eyes.I snarled, curling my index finger deep, thumb triggering the release. Arala. The Bent Finger. Not a sloppy pulse, but a focused Kinetic Gust. A sudden, violent vacuum shrieked from my palm. The air screamed as I displaced it.The pulse hit the Vector mage square in the chest. He flew backward, slamming into a dumpster with a crash that echoed off the alley walls. My palms scorched, the recoil a hot wire snapping through my wrists. For one second—one gloriously stupid second—I felt like a protagonist again.Then the Suppression specialist moved.He'd been circling. Patient. Professional. His fingers had been busy the whole time, and now I saw why: a pale chalk circle glowed on the pavement beneath my feet, hidden under a thin layer of slush. Alchemical symbols pulsed along its perimeter—binding glyphs, dampening sigils, a fucking suppression array.The power hemorrhaged out of me.Not fade—die. Like someone had ripped the plug from a socket. The runic wards I had tattooed on my forearms went dark. The ambient thaumic field that had been buzzing at the edge of my senses went silent. My connection to the Old Speech, to the raw causal weight of existence itself, was severed.
"No—" I started.
The suppression field clamped down like a vice. My muscles locked. My lungs stuttered. Every metaphysical nerve in my body screamed as the alchemy scoured my mana channels raw.No. NO.I pushed back.I don't know where the strength came from—rage, maybe, or the memory of my mother's hands teaching me to reach past limitation. The suppression field flickered. The alchemical circle beneath me cracked along one edge, chalk flaking away.For one heartbeat, my magic roared.The wards on my arms blazed back to life—not violet this time, but a molten, furious magenta glaring through phantom cracks in my skin. The air around me superheated. The slush at my feet flash-boiled into steam. Suppression Jim's eyes went wide.
"Triśūla—" I started to grit out, my fingers straining to form the Trident, the syllable tearing at my throat.
Then the Suppression Specialist slammed a dampening glyph into my spine.The world went white.The suppression field doubled in intensity, tripled, until I couldn't feel where my body ended and the binding glyphs began. My knees buckled. My face slammed into the icy concrete, the impact sending a shockwave through my jaw. I bit my tongue for the third time today. My mouth filled with fresh, warm copper.
"HOW FUCKING ELABORATE DO WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS FIGHT?!"
I screamed into the slush, the words bubbling through blood and spit.It was absurd. All of it. The choreography, the precision, the teamwork. They'd done this before. Hunted mages. Broken sorcerers. I was just another line item.I looked up at them from the slush. Three faces, three expressions of professional boredom. They weren't fighting me anymore. They were processing me. Administrative Violence—impersonal and absolute.The pain bloomed late, a sudden, hot fire in my chest and leg that washed over me, drowning out the cold. I gasped, finally sucking in a ragged breath that tasted of stricken matches.The shock went deeper than physical. In the span of ten seconds, I had gone from sorcerer to meat.Stop struggling, my brain commanded. Your magic is offline. You can't win a physical contest against three trained enforcers. This isn't the field; the old unit isn't coming for you.I needed to survive. I shut down my emotional centers, visualizing a heavy steel shutter closing over my fear—and that new, hungry heat.Switch to Analytical Mode, I whispered to the pavement. Observe. Record. Survive. And don't shit yourself.
Context: Bodhi analyzes his injuries through the lens of medical billing codes.
The world reoriented itself ninety degrees. I was suddenly intimate with the slush, staring at it from a distance of two inches. The cold seeped instantly through my clothes, a shock of ice water against burning skin.I tried to inhale, but my chest wall refused to expand. There was a deep, grinding sensation in my left side, like two tectonic plates rubbing together. It isn’t pain yet; it was just a wrongness. A mechanical failure of the chassis.My mind stuttered, trying to process the data input. Impact detected. Structural integrity compromised.I coughed, and the motion sent a jolt of white-hot agony through my ribcage that made my vision black out for a microsecond. The pain was absolute, a singular point of focus that obliterated the cold, the snow, and the Soldati standing over me.I didn't scream. Screaming requires breath I didn’t have. Instead, I forced my eyes to focus on the mud in front of my face.I saw a cigarette butt (Synthi-Slim, menthol). A shard of green glass (Heineken bottle, pre-war). A frozen rat turd (Rattus norvegicus).I named them. Nicotine delivery system. Silicon waste. Bio-waste. I forced my brain to categorize the environment to keep from drowning in the sensation of my own broken bones.The pain tried to pull me under, but my training kicked in—not the healing arts, but the billing codes. My mind involuntarily overlaid "Fiscal Metadata" onto the injury, projecting a glowing blue HUD onto the dirty snow.I visualized the fracture line on my fourth rib. ICD-10 Code S22.40xB: Multiple fractures of ribs, initial encounter.I ran the numbers.Cost of a Level 4 bone knit: 500 credits.
Anesthesia (local block): 200 credits.
Post-op suppressants (Percocet-IV): 50 credits per dose.But that was just the physical damage. My mind—treacherously thorough—kept scrolling.TMI-7.2: Thaumic Nerve Burnout, secondary to forced suppression. Cost: 2,200 credits.
TMI-3.1: Mana Channel Scarring, alchemical origin. Cost: 1,800 credits, non-reversible.The suppression hex they'd hit me with? That was going to leave entropy scars that would ache every time I tried to cast for the next six months. Maybe longer. The kind of magical nerve damage that insurance companies classified as "pre-existing condition" the moment you filed a claim.The realization hit harder than the boot: I was broken—physically and metaphysically—and I couldn't afford to be fixed. The Soldati hadn't just beaten me; they had levied a fine measured in years of my life.Every breath that grated bone-on-bone was a reminder of my negative net worth. Every time my mana channels twitched in phantom protest, I was hemorrhaging credit I didn't have.Stop it, I told the HUD. Data doesn't hurt. Data requires processing.I chose not to be a victim; I chose to be an auditor. I closed my eyes and visualized my ribcage as a 3D schematic, highlighting the fracture in angry red. I "equipped" the pain, wearing it like a heavy coat rather than letting it crush me.They could break the hardware. They couldn't touch the source code.The beating found a rhythm. A metronome of violence played out on the snare drum of my torso. It was a calibration I recognized from the brass's classified briefings: how to tenderize a high-value asset without breaking the hardware.Thud. Pause. Thud. Pause.They'd settled into a formation—the Suppression specialist maintained the dampening field, keeping my magic pinned like a butterfly on corkboard. Kinetic Knuckles delivered the blows, each one landing with that sick, amplified crack that turned bruises into fractures. The Vector mage circled, favoring his left leg, watching, adjusting angles, ready to redirect any desperate movement I might attempt.Military. Clockwork. They'd done this to mages before. I was just another entry in their logbook.I curled tighter into the fetal position, knees drawn up to my chin.
"Three against one," I wheezed through a mouthful of copper-tasting slush. "Real heroic, boys. Your mothers must be so proud."
A kinetically-amplified boot slammed into my thigh, silencing the commentary. The impact condensed into a single point of white-hot agony.These weren't the chaotic, frenzy-kicks of street thugs high on stims. These were professionals with spells. They were placing their shots with the precision of butchers separating cuts of meat. The sound was wet and dense—leather on wet wool on bruising flesh—punctuated by the sharp, electric crack of magically-enhanced impacts near my kidneys.I curled tighter, head tucked down. But my primary focus—my obsession—was my hands.I wove my fingers together and jammed them deep into the space between my chest and my thighs, creating a fortress of bone and muscle to shield them.Not the hands, I chanted internally, the mantra looping like a corrupted audio file. Anything but the hands.They were my interface. My livelihood. The only tools I had left to interact with the world's code. If they broke, I was offline permanently. A wizard without gestures is just a lunatic muttering at the sky.The Soldati seemed to sense my strategy. They adjusted their vector, aiming lower, targeting my thighs and the exposed curve of my spine. The pain was blinding, a white noise that threatened to drown out my "Surgical HUD," but through the haze, I noticed something odd about the timing.They were stopping every few seconds. They were letting me gasp for air, letting my heart rate stabilize just enough to keep me from passing out, before delivering the next blow.They are managing my vitals, I realized with a jolt of horror that cut through the agony.Not an execution. A calibration. They needed me functional.Dead debtors don't pay interest.
Unconscious debtors can't accept terms.They walked a razor's edge. They inflicted suffering without causing permanent damage that would lower my resale value. I was being "tenderized."One of the Jims delivered a sharp, testing kick to my exposed elbow, trying to pry my arms away from my chest. It sent a shockwave up my ulnar nerve that felt like liquid lightning. The instinct to uncurl, to fling my arms out to protect my body, was overwhelming. My lizard brain screamed at me to surrender, to open up and beg for it to stop.I clamped my jaw shut so hard I felt a molar crack. I overrode the lizard brain."It's a good thing you're funny, Jimbo," I wheezed through a mouthful of copper-tasting slush, "since you're the uglier triplet."He didn't even flinch. He just kicked me again.I mean, I thought it was funny. I deliberately relaxed my ribs, accepting that they were ablative armor. I kept my hands locked tight, burying them deeper into my gut.Take the chassis, I thought, tears of pain leaking from my squeezed-shut eyes. Break the housing. Wreck the frame. But you don't get the goddamn tools.I stayed curled in the slush, trading broken ribs for intact fingers.The violence stopped as it began. There was no wind-down, no panting exhaustion—a sudden cessation of impact.A gloved hand tangled into my hair, yanking my head back with enough force to strain the vertebrae in my neck. The world spun from gray slush to the gray face of the lead Soldato, hovering inches from my own.He smelled of stale coffee and recently applied cologne. It was a mundane, office-worker scent that clashed with the brutality of the moment.
"The Director expects your presence at the Estate tomorrow, dusk," the Soldato said, his voice dropping to a conversational register. "Clear your schedule; it's a mandatory consult. Don't be late again."
The words—clipped, precise.He spoke the words like he was reciting a grocery list. His eyes were dead. No enjoyment. No hatred. A courier delivering a package that happened to be a threat.I stared into his eyes, scanning for something—sadism, reluctance, any data point to file. I found nothing. Just the flat operational gaze of a man clocking overtime.The humiliation washed over me, hot and shameful. A rival had not beaten me; a tool beat me. I was trembling from the sheer indignity of being handled like livestock.Subject lacks metadata, I thought, my mind retreating to the safety of critique. No distinct features. No narrative weight. A Non-Player Character.This man didn't matter. He was just a pixel in Marco's rendering. The debt had shifted. It was no longer about the 500 potential credits for the rib; it was about "Service." Marco didn't want money anymore; he wanted ownership. The beating was the down payment.The Soldato released my hair with a shove, letting my head snap back down toward the concrete. I caught myself with one hand—the hand is safe, thank god—but my cheek smacked into the slush. The wet cold was shocking against my burning skin.I heard them turn and walk away, their boots crunching on the gravel, already moving on to the next item on their agenda. Ideally, they would "double-tap" me, but I was an Asset now. Assets are preserved.I lay there for a moment, listening to the fading footsteps. I tasted copper and grit.The "Consult" was a trap, a servitude contract wrapped in a job offer. I had to take it. I had no choice. But I could still refuse the narrative of submission.I gathered the blood and saliva pooling in my mouth and spat it onto the pristine white snow next to my face.
"Tomorrow," I whispered into the slush. The alley fell silent again, but it was a heavier silence now, weighed down by the accumulated violence.The snow continued to fall, indifferent to the blood staining the concrete. It covered the red slush with a fresh layer of pristine white. The beating had kept me warm. Now the cold sank its teeth in. Every exposed nerve screamed. The cuts on my face crystallized, flesh freezing to the air itself.The adrenaline evaporated. The pain crashed back in.No longer a sharp signal—a throbbing, systemic ache that pulsed in perfect sync with my heartbeat. Chilled barbed wire wrapped my ribs. My jaw ached with a dull, hydraulic pressure that radiated up into my sinuses.I groaned, a wet, ragged sound that puffed out in a white cloud of vapor.Diagnostic check.I forced my eyes open. I ignored the ribs, the jaw, the throbbing warmth in my legs. I lifted my hands.They hovered in the gray air, trembling. There was swelling across the knuckles—edema from the impact—and the skin was raw from the cold, but the structure...I flexed the left hand. Then the right. Full extension. Range of motion unimpeded. The metacarpals were intact.A laugh bubbled up in my chest, turned into a painful wheeze.The tools are safe.The laugh dislodged something in my mouth. I felt a hard script of enamel loose against my tongue. I spat it out.My tongue traced the gap in my gumline. It was a permanent subtraction. I would never get that tooth back. The transaction with the Soldati had left a permanent receipt.I stared at the tooth, my mind framing the shot. *White tooth. Red blood. Gray snow.**
"It’s a bit on the nose," I murmured to the empty alley, my voice thick with blood. "Color grading is too high-contrast. Cliché symbolism."
I slammed my palm against the rusted flank of the dumpster, using the leverage to force my body upright. Every bone in my legs threatened to buckle. My ribs screamed. My vision swam with gray spots, but I pushed through, refusing to stay on the ground. The ground is for corpses and trash.I dragged myself to my feet, swaying like a drunk, listing to the left to favor my broken rib. Each breath was a negotiation with pain.I was standing. In New Canaan, that was the only victory available.Leaning against the rusted flank of the dumpster, I looked up.Above the canyon of the alley, the New Canaan Hospital tower rose like a monolith of glass and steel. The upper floors—the VIP wards, the gene-therapy suites, the executive offices—were glowing with a soft, periwinkle light.The glow was the color of health and money—the hue of a world I used to live in.A pang of loss hit me, sharper than the broken rib. Deeper than nostalgia. A door had closed. Yesterday, I walked those halls as a resident, a healer, a student of the Asclepius Guild. Today, I was standing in the trash looking up at heaven.Class measured the distance between the alley and those windows.The genre had shifted. The network cancelled the Medical Drama.I am the fucking servant again.Cue the title card, I thought. Looney Tunes font. Sad jazz.I wiped the blood from my chin with the back of my hand. I pushed myself off the dumpster, testing my balance. It held. Damage existed, but I was functional.The "Quest"—work for Marco, pay the debt, keep my father out of the mass grave—was locked in. There were no side quests. There was no fast travel.
"Dusk," I said aloud, the word forming a puff of steam in the freeze-frame air.An appointment and a sentence.I turned my back on the Optimistic Blue light of the hospital and looked down the dark throat of the alley.I started walking. One step. Then another. The pain was there, constant and loud.I tapped the rhythm of it against the pavement as I walked into the next scene.]]></description><link>manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-05-draft.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Projects/Writing/Books/The Cleric Saga/_bmad-output/manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-05-draft.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:17:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[chapter-04-draft]]></title><description><![CDATA[
[SIGNAL FRAGMENT // SOURCE: CLANDESTINE_RELAY_BETA // STATUS: DECRYPTION_ACTIVE] They teach you magic is a gift. A shimmering, benevolent extra-dimension that rewards the pious and the disciplined. Lies. Magic isn’t a gift; it’s a parasite that eats the soul and shits fire. It’s the fifth fundamental force, but it’s the only one with a personality—and that personality is predominantly sociopathic. We call it Personal Magic because it’s the shape of your scars. Emitters, Manipulators, Enhancers... we’re just a taxonomy of trauma.
But the real trick? The Aria. Thirteen Stages to a total dissolution of self. You don’t "cast" an Aria. You unravel into it. Stage One is a somatic grounding; Stage Three is the first time you feel the reality-puckering at the edge of your vision. By Stage Five, your Oversoul manifests—the monstrous projection of your psyche, a god-form built from everything you’ve repressed. And if you survive to the Thirteenth? You don’t just have magic. You become the reality. You are the Dominion. No off-switch. No mercy. Just godhood with a human-sized hole in the middle.
Magic doesn’t listen to your words. It listens to your truth. To the cracks in your identity. That’s why the more you break, the more powerful you become. The Academy spends four years trying to teach you how to bottle it, how to label it "Safe for Consumption." But you can’t bottle a hurricane. You can only survive it. Or, if you’re like me, you can learn to steer it toward the people who deserve to be hit.
The tribunal doors seal behind me with a sound like a guillotine dropping—sharp, final, and smelling of ozone and dead mahogany. The hydraulics sigh, a weary institutional groan that seems to mock the racing of my pulse. For half a heartbeat, my reflection hangs in the dark veneer of the wood: pallid, eyes rimmed with the magenta heat-haze of a spent null-field, the profile of a man who just committed career suicide and hasn't yet felt the gravity of the fall. Then the ward-sigils ignite across the panels, a sequence of cold blue runes that wash my reflection away. The Academy is already erasing me. I do not linger. The Hall of Archival Glories stretches before me, a twelve-hundred-foot spine of white marble and channeled basalt designed to make an aspirant feel like a microbe in a cathedral. The clerestory windows, narrow as arrow-slits, funnel the moonlight into cold, geometric bars that slice the air. Each segment is interrupted by a vitrine of night-quartz, ten feet tall and humming with stasis-fields. Inside, the relics of the 'Sanctified' stand at attention—staffs of petrified moonbeam, masks of tear-stained aether, the calcified remains of clerics who followed every regulatory protocol until the day they died. My boots echo—klak-klak-klak—a rhythmic, syncopated intrusion in the silence. With every third step, the probation brand on my wrist flares. It’s a rhythmic, agonizing pulse: ACADEMY ACCESS — LIMITED • DISCIPLINARY WATCH — ACTIVE. The brand is a parasite, keyed to the Academy’s central ward-net. It doesn’t just mark me; it monitors my internal mana-pressure, a leash made of burning light.I pass the first vitrine: "High Cleric Selene d’Argent — Saved 144,000 souls." Her staff is a testament to the integrated Vital Stabilization Protocol—the clinical, neutered version of the miracle I performed tonight in a rain-slicked alley. The plaque lists her Knighthoods, her compliance certifications, her service to the Council. She saved 144,000 people because they were on a manifest. I saved one kid because her brother begged me, and the Academy is currently debating which circle of administrative hell I belong in. I stop at the mid-point arch, where the statue of Darius Ko’thun glowers down, obsidian eyes polished to a flat, gunmetal glaze. His plinth is inscribed with the maxim that every first-year is forced to carve into their own forearm: "Mercy, tempered by regulation, is still mercy."
"Is it really, Darius?" I whisper. My voice is thin, brittle, lost in the vastness of the vaulted stone. "Or is it just a way to make sure the suffering happens at a controlled, taxable rate?"
The statue offers no guidance. The only answer is the automated click of a scribe-orb—a Forensic Auditor—as it swivels its lenses from a recessed niche in the ceiling to track the unauthorized heat signature of my rage. The salient emotion isn't rage, though. Rage is a fuel, and I’m burning through my reserves too fast. What’s left is a cold, hollowing certainty. The Academy isn't just punishing me; they’re going to erase the incident. Within forty-eight hours, the boy’s testimony will be "administratively de-prioritized," the girl’s medical records will be "lost to a storage glitch," and my null-field resurrection will be filed as a "unlicensed hallucination." I look at the fork in the corridor ahead. To the west, the Residential Towers. Sanctioned sleep. A bed, a final packet of disciplinary papers, and a quiet exit at dawn. The path of the Coward. To the east, the Lecture Halls. And specifically, the Cordon of Silent Truths. The Cordon is a high-density suppression grid that guards the Academy’s "Legacy Assets"—the rooms they don't want the public, or even the general student body, to remember. Lecture Hall C is behind that grid. It was shuttered after the '98 Synthesis Riot, but the infrastructure remains—unmonitored, archaic, and connected to the Sanitizer Relays. The Sanitizers. The maintenance caste that mops the floors and clears the mana-residue from the classrooms. They have their own network, a series of sub-net conduits that predate the modern Aegis filters. If I can reach Hall C. If I can bypass the Cordon. A pulse of fire from the probation brand reminds me of the cost. To bypass the Cordon while wearing a disciplinary leash is a Class I Felony. It’s "Unauthorized Interaction with Sovereign Sigils." It’s an act of war. I toe the seam between the marble tiles and the basalt inlays. It feels like a continental rift. Choice A: Go to bed. Forget the girl. Forget the truth. Become a footnote.
Choice B: Burn the bridge while you're still standing on it.The memory of the girl’s brother surfaces—the smell of cheap raincoats and the desperate, crushing grip of his hand. "I’ll settle for relevance," I mutter to the obsidian eyes of Ko’thun. I turn east. The transition is immediate. The hallway narrows, the grand marble giving way to the functional granite of the auxiliary wings. The torch-runes here are spaced further apart, their glow a jaundiced, flickering yellow. The air drops ten degrees. Ahead, the Cordon of Silent Truths manifests as a shimmering wall of distorted air. It doesn't just block the path; it warps the very concept of 'forward.' It looks like a heat-haze, but it tastes like copper and dead batteries. It’s a multi-layered ward-fence: a physical barrier, a mana-filter, and a behavioral-correction sigil that triggers a spike of nausea in anyone who hasn't been administratively cleared to pass. I slow my pace, heart hammering against my ribs like a trapped bird. My probation brand is already screaming, the violet light intensifying until it’s a blinding beacon against the dim stone walls. The brand isn't just a light; it's a weight. It pulls at the tendons of my wrist, a localized gravity well of 'Compliance.' "Alright," I breathe, my own breath turning to white mist in the ward-chill. "Let's see if the textbooks were lying about ward-harmonics. Let's see if 'Absolute Compliance' has a breaking point."
I reach out, not with my hand, but with the 'ghost-touch' of my null-field. To the uninitiated, it looks like a twitch of the fingers. To me, it feels like extending a raw nerve into a hurricane. In this world, most mages are 'Additives'—they add energy, they build structures, they create fire from nothing. They are the architects of the 'Visible God.' I am a 'Subtractive.' I find the seams in reality—the tiny, microscopic cracks where the Aria didn't quite take—and I pull. I am the rot in the floorboards. The Cordon is built on a resonance of Regulated Peace. It's a symphony of 'Yes.' To break it, I don't need more power; I need to introduce a 'Division-by-Zero' error. I need to be the 'No.'I focus on the central node of the ward—a fist-sized sapphire embedded in the center of the archway, glowing with a steady, rhythmic pulse. It’s the heartbeat of the grid. Lub-dub. Lub-dub. Obey. Obey.I extend a needle-thin filament of entropy. The moment my magic touches the Cordon, reality screams. Not a sound, but a vibration that rattles my molar-fillings. The probation brand bites with a ferocity that drops me to one knee. A jolt of corrective electricity—a Compliance Shock—surges up my arm, turning my blood to molten lead. DON'T PULL BACK.The textbook says a Compliance Shock is designed to 'redirect the subject's intent.' It’s a violent, magical gaslighting. My brain tells me I'm in the wrong room. It tells me my mother is still alive and waiting for me in the dorms. It tells me the girl in the alley never existed. "She... existed," I wheeze, my vision tunneling into a red-and-violet kaleidoscope. I push through the cognitive dissonance, my sweat turning to ice. I find the ward's frequency—a low-frequency hum like a distant temple bell. I match it. I feel the sapphire's pulse in my own marrow. Then, with a scream I can't quite voice, I shift my frequency by one half-tone. The resonance is agonizing. It feels like my bones are being vibrated in a centrifuge, the calcium turning to dust. The air between me and the sapphire begins to crack, local space-time fracturing into tiny, obsidian shards of unreality. "Almost... there..." I snap the filament. The wall of distorted air shatters. Not with a bang, but with a sharp, crystalline tink—the sound of a diamond-cutter's mistake. For one beautiful, terrifying second, the Cordon is blind. The sapphire's light flickers, a dying ember in a storm. I bolt through. I’m on the other side before the Sapphire can reset, but the price is already being extracted. My left hand is numb, the fingers locked in a clawed position. A line of fine, soot-like ash begins to drift from the pores of my skin—Entropy Bleed. My body is beginning to de-render, the universe deciding that if I won't follow the rules of its existence, I don't get to be part of it. I don't stop. I can't stop. If I stop, the ash will reach my heart. I’m in the Sanitizer Tunnels now—the service corridors that run like a subterranean nervous system behind the Academy's grand architecture. Here, the marble of the Archival Glories is replaced by raw, weeping granite and heavy iron pipes that throb with the transit of mana-slurry. The smell is thick—alkaline, dusty, and laced with the scent of 'Old Arguments.' I hear a sound. A rhythmic, metallic scrape. I freeze, my back against a damp pipe that burns with residual mana-heat. A figure emerges from the gloom. Not a Regulator. Not a Cleric. It’s a Sanitizer. He’s wearing the heavy, grey canvas coveralls of the maintenance caste. His face is a roadmap of 'Thaumic Scarring'—the silvery, ropey welts that come from cleaning up the high-clerics' magical spills without a protective ward. He’s pushing a cart laden with 'Spent Focus-Crystals'—dim, grey lumps of rock that used to be miracles. He stops. He looks at me. His eyes are clouded with cataracts, but he sees me. He sees the probation brand. I pull the scribe-orb from my satchel—not a lucky find, but the Forensic Auditor 09 I hijacked from the Archival hallway while it was distracted by the sheer, blatant illegality of my 'Cordon Breach.' Its lenses are still spinning, a frantic, mechanical whirring that sounds like a hive of angry hornets. Behind the smoked-glass aperture, a cluster of red sensors flickers, trying to re-index my heat signature against the Academy’s database of 'Non-Compliant Entities.'I jam the orb’s interface-needle into the Samizdat relay box. The orb shrieks. Not with a sound, but with a high-pitched electronic wail that vibrates directly against my skull. A cascade of diagnostic runes floods the air, glowing a frantic, warning red. UNAUTHORIZED DATA-UPSTREAM — SOURCE: AUDITOR_09 // PROTOCOL: SANITIZER_SAMIZDAT // STATUS: BREACH_DETECTED
"Hush," I say, my voice raw and tasting of the copper-tang of entropy. I press my thumb against the orb's 'Ethics-Filter' plate. This is the part they don't teach in the 'Approved Artifacts' seminars. Every Auditor-orb has a soul-buffer—a tiny, fragmented consciousness built from the recorded memories of 'Witness-Clerics.' It’s not an AI; it’s a ghost in a bottle. I reach into that bottle. Stage Two: The Sight of the Severed Chain.My sub-Aria flares, and I find the ghost. It’s a cold, calcified thing—the memory of a man who spent forty years cataloging 'Regulatory Inconsistencies.' He’s a snitch by nature, a creature made of footnotes. You're not a snitch anymore, I tell him, my thought-lattice pressing against the orb's internal wards. Now, you're a megaphone. You're the one who tells the truth they tried to edit out.The orb’s red glyph flickers to violet. It fights back, a surge of 'Administrative Will' trying to purge my connection. It feels like a thousand tiny needles stitching my brain to the relay box. I see flashes of the Academy’s 'Redact-Protocols'—the digital guillotines that drop on any file containing the words 'Inequality,' 'Harm,' or 'Rao.'
"You want to save these files?" I whisper, my forehead resting against the cold iron of the box. "Then you have to broadcast them. You have to put them where they can't be deleted. Give them to the Sanitizers. Give them to the Echo-Samizdat."
I override the orb's 'Archive-Only' directive. I force it into 'Broadcast-Resonance' mode. The air in the tunnel begins to vibrate with a frequency that makes the iron pipes scream. The mana-slurry inside the conduits overhead groans, the thick, pearlescent liquid surging as the broadcast begins to pull power directly from the Academy's own grid. It’s a parasitic leak, a digital virus riding on the back of institutional prestige. I can feel the 'Net-Overseers' in the North Atlantic grid sensing the drain, their automated filters frantically trying to categorize the surge. They think it’s a 'Mana-Spill' in the cooling tiers. I have maybe fifteen minutes before they trace the resonance. Maybe ten before the physical strike-teams reach the Sanitizer levels. I climb the rusted service ladder that leads to the sub-floor of Lecture Hall C. The rungs are slick with a black, oily mana-residue that smells of ozone and burnt hair. Every step is an effort, my left hand feeling like a dead weight of heavy lead and grey ash. The door to the hall is iron, heavy, and scuffed by a century of use. It holds no suppression wards—the Academy in its infinite arrogance thinks Hall C is too dead, too dusty, too 'auxiliary' to be a threat. I push. The latch gives with a reluctant clack, and a breath of stale, paper-scented air ghosts across my face. It's the smell of dead arguments and forgotten homework. Hall C is a tomb. Eighty-seven seats, rising in tiered mahogany benches toward a vaulted ceiling of dark granite. The Academy crest on the back wall—the ouroboros serpent—is covered in a fine layer of dust, as if the knowledge here has finished devouring itself. I stand on the threshold of the dais, the scribe-orb floating beside me like a silent, red-eyed ghost. It's ready. The Samizdat network is primed. The Sanitizer relays are waiting for the payload. My wrist is burning. The probation brand has evolved from a mark into a brand of fire. My left hand is a trail of grey smoke. The Academy is probably already burning my digital files, erasing my enrollment, turning my scholarship into a 'Processing Error.' But I am in the room. And the Signal is live. I climb the steps to the lectern, my boots sounding like gunshots in the emptiness. I drop my satchel on the stage with a thunk that echoes through the arches like a closing argument. I reach into my mind, grasping for the first line of my Aria, the somatic anchor I’ll need to hold my identity together during the broadcast. Stage One: The Silence Between Breath.I close my eyes. I don't start with a word; I start with a 'Negative Space.' I find the rhythm of the Academy's main mana-pulse—the deep, oceanic thrum of the transatlantic conduits—and I begin to 'Phase-Shift' my own aura against it. It’s like trying to sing a note exactly one millimeter away from the melody. The air around the lectern begins to frost, the humidity in the room crystallizing into tiny, violet-tinted flakes of snow that defy gravity. They don't fall; they orbit my head in a jittery, entropic cloud. This is the Sub‑Aria in its rawest form—the logic of 'Not.' The Auditor-orb responds, its lenses clicking into a 'Macro-Focus' mode. The red sensor-light spills across the mahogany benches, illuminating the century of dust. As the Signal Rune activates, the dust doesn't just swirl; it Architects itself. The particles form fleeting, ghostly shapes in the air—brief, flickering outlines of students who sat here decades ago, their forgotten whispers amplified by the broadcast's parasitic draw. I can feel the 'Samizdat' relay in the sub-floor thrumming with a heat that borders on the structural-fail point. The Sanitizers' forgotten infrastructure is being pushed to its limit, the iron pipes below the floorboards glowing a dull, cherry red as they route the illicit data. "My name is Bodhi Rao," I say, and my voice is carried not by air, but by the very vibration of the granite walls. "And I am a thief."
I look out at the sea of empty seats, imagining them filled with every person who ever waited for a miracle that never came. My father. My mother. Reena in the alley. I open my mouth. My voice is small, jagged, and terrifyingly real. "Let's talk about magic," I begin. The acoustics of Hall C catch the line and stretch it, feeding it back to me with a cavernous depth that makes my own voice sound like a stranger's. I wait for the echo to settle, for the Sanitizer relay to sync with the Auditor’s lens. The red glyph on the orb's casing pulses once, twice—a heartbeat in the dark. "You ever notice," I continue, pacing the length of the dais, "how every lecture on miracle ethics starts with the phrase ‘in a controlled environment’? Controlled. Not compassionate. Not courageous. Controlled. As if the universe gifts us energy so we can bottle it, label it, and sell it at cost plus interest. As if the soul is something we're meant to guard, not spill, even when someone is dying at our feet."
I stop at the edge of the stage, the wood creaking under my boots. My hand—the one turning to ash—throbs with a cold, rhythmic fire. "I spent three years swallowing syllabus pap that claims magic is a privilege. A privilege!" I bark a laugh, a dry, ugly sound that ricochets around the granite arches. "Tell that to the boy I met tonight. Tell that to his sister, whose lungs were collapsing because the nearest sanctioned clinic wouldn't open its doors without a credit-vouchering sigil from a Tier-1 Archon. Magic isn't a privilege, you bastards. It's a fundamental right of the sentient spirit. And when you hoard it, when you price it in platinum and permissions, you aren't 'regulating' it. You're committing theft."
I feel the room begin to fight back. The izilite chandeliers overhead flicker, the Academy's central Net sensing the parasitic drain. The acoustics shift, my voice suddenly dying a few feet from my lips as the suppression-lattices try to dampen the resonance. I don't reach for a microphone. I reach for my Aria. Stage Two: The Sight of the Severed Chain.The air around me thickens, the smell of ozone and lilac Intensifying until it's a physical weight. My voice triples in volume, not through volume, but through 'Aetheric Authority.' "They tell us it’s for safety. Sure. Safety. But whose?" I scream it now, the words tearing at my throat. "Not my mother's. You remember Dr. Nalini Rao? Sorceress of the Silver Hands? The 'Sanctified' Alumni roll has her name at the bottom, marked in grey ink. They don't mention how she died."
My breath hitching. The memory of her last night surges up, and for a second, I’m not in Hall C. I’m back in the cramped, sterile ward of the NAMF trauma center, twelve years ago. The air in the ward smelled of cheap disinfectant, the metallic tang of failing wards, and the specific, cloying sweetness of 'Aetheric Decay.' My mother lay on the cot, her skin the color of damp parchment, her hands—the hands that had rewoven ten thousand hearts with the precision of a master weaver—trembling as she tried to sketch a basic stabilization rune in the air. "Bodhi," she whispered, her voice a dry rattle like dead leaves on pavement. "Stay... stay behind the curtain. Don't let them... don't let them see you're like me."
She knew even then. She knew the 'Subtractive' seed was in me, and she knew the Academy would prune it. A heavy thud sounded at the ward doors. Not the soft, rhythmic click of a nurse's heels, but the metallic, unyielding clang of a Regulator’s boot. The door hissed open. Two men in crimson-and-gold enamel armor stepped into the room. They didn't look like doctors. They didn't even look like humans. They were Patent Enforcers from the Aegis-Mender Consortium, their faces hidden behind masks of polished godsteel that reflected my mother's agony as a distorted, gleaming curve. "Dr. Nalini Rao," the lead Enforcer said, his voice flattened by the vox-grille into a monotonous, institutional drone. "You are in possession of a Class-B 'High-Efficiency Cardiac Resonance' sigil. According to the latest Council Directive, that sigil—and all its derivative harmonics—is the exclusive intellectual property of the Aegis-Mender Consortium." "I... I designed that sigil," my mother gasped, a line of dark, oxygen-starved blood leaking from the corner of her mouth. Her fingers spasmed, the rune she was trying to form flickering and dying. "I gave it to the public... for the poor who can't afford the Tier-1 stabilization..." "The public domain status of the Rao-Signature was revoked as of 03:00 hours this morning," the Enforcer said, stepping toward the bed. He unslung a Siphon-Rod—a three-foot length of dark obsidian etched with 'Reclamation Sigils.' It looked like a weapon, but it was worse. It was a ledger with teeth. "You are currently utilizing a proprietary healing-logic without a valid, paid-up subscription. This is a violation of the 'Sacramental Property Act.' You will cease casting immediately." "She’s dying!" I screamed, lunging from behind the curtain. I grabbed the Enforcer's armored forearm, my small hands feeling like they were trying to hold back a moving mountain. "She needs the sigil! It’s the only thing keeping her heart in rhythm!"
The second Enforcer held me back with a cold, armored hand that smelled of gun-oil and old incense. "The law is a ward, boy," he said, and I could hear the boredom in his voice. This was his tenth 'Reclamation' of the day. "It protects us all from the chaos of unlicensed magic. Your mother is a thief."I watched as they pressed the Siphon-Rod to my mother's sternum. I watched the golden light of her healing-magic—the beautiful, intricate sigil she had spent twenty years perfecting in the gutters of New Canaan—be sucked out of her chest. The rod hummed with a satisfied, gluttonous vibration as it pulled the energy out of her marrow, leaving nothing behind but the 'grey-ink' of her expiration. She didn't even scream. She just looked at me, her eyes filling with a terrible, lucid clarity as the magic she had used to save thousands was packed into a storage-chamber to be sold back to the rich. The Enforcers didn't even look at her body as they left. They just logged the 'successful reclamation' on their slabs, checked their watches, and walked out into the Hall of Archival Glories to find their next 'debtor.' I slam my fist onto the lectern, the obsidian veining glowing a violent, reactive blue. The crack of the wood echoes like a gunshot. "I watched them reclaim her life because it wasn't 'profitable' to let her keep her own soul," I roar. "And I realized then that the only difference between a Cleric and a Bandit is the quality of their paperwork."
I take a ragged breath, the friction burns on my neck beginning to smoke. I can feel the 'Net-Overseers' now—they're starting a 'Deep-Net Cauterization.' They're trying to burn the Sanitizer relays one by one. "The Academy claims I’m reckless. They claim I’m a heretic. And you know what? They’re right. I am reckless. I am a heretic. Because I’d rather burn this entire institution to the ground than spend one more minute pretending that letting someone die 'politely' is a virtue."
I lean forward, my face inches from the Auditor’s lens. "I’m going to tell you a secret the Archons don't want you to know. The Aria isn't a ritual. It’s a key. And I'm leaking the decryption codes for Stage One into this Signal. Anyone with enough mana to stay awake can catch it. Anyone with the guts to use it can start healing their own. No permits. No licensing fees. No permission slips from men who'd rather count gold than heartbeats."
I can hear the physical strike-teams now—the heavy, rhythmic thud of armored boots in the tunnels below. They're coming for the source. "I don't know if I’m the hero of this story," I admit, and the admission tastes like copper and failure. "In fact, I know I’m not. I’m a selfish, arrogant prick who enjoyed the power of that null-field too much. I enjoyed the God-complex of being the one who decided if she lived or died. I’m just as broken as the system I’m fighting. But at least I’m not lying about it."
I pace back toward the center of the dais, the shadow of the ouroboros serpent stretching long and jagged behind me. "You want the truth? Here it is: I didn't save that girl because I'm a saint. I saved her because I was tired of feeling small. I was tired of being the boy who watched his mother's magic be harvested like a crop. I wanted to feel the weight of a life in my hands, and I wanted to see the look on a Regulator's face when I took it away from them."
I look down at my good hand, the one that still has skin. It’s shaking. "I stole a focus crystal from a first-year's locker three weeks ago. An 'E-Grade Stabilization Mote.' I didn't need it; I just wanted to see if I could bypass the locker's ward-trace. I wanted to see if I was smarter than the system. And when I used that crystal to boost my field tonight? I didn't feel guilty. I felt... high. I felt the 'Aria-High' they warn you about in the cautionary tales, the one that turns mages into gods before it turns them into craters."
I turn back to the Auditor’s lens, my eyes wide and bloodshot. "My father is dying in a public ward that smells of bleach and forgotten names. He doesn't remember who I am. Half the time, he thinks I'm the orderly who comes to change the mana-drip. And you know what the worst part is? I hate him for it. I hate his weakness. I hate the way he unraveled like a cheap cassette tape. I came here to find a world that worked, and instead I found a museum that charges admission to see the corpses of better men."
I straighten my back, the 'Entropy Bleed' from my left hand now a visible trail of grey smoke that spirals into the rafters. "Let the world catch fire," I say softly, more to myself than to the audience. "At least we'll have enough light to see who's holding the matches. At least we'll stop pretending that the dark is just 'mismanaged illumination.'"
You catch all of that? With me so far?
Really? Okay.Explain it back to me then.I reach up and snap the interface-needle of the Auditor-orb. Looking into the red sensor one last time, I whisper the first line of the transcript I’ve already written in my head.
"Let's talk about magic."
The resonance doesn't stop immediately. It tapers off like a dying scream, the violet light in the room fading into a cold, grey twilight.
The Auditor-orb drops to the floor with a metallic 'clatter,' its lenses shattered, its soul-buffer finally silent. I stand there for a moment, the silence of Hall C heavier than it was before. My left hand is a charred ruin of ash and bone-shadow. The 'Entropy Bleed' has stopped, but the mark is permanent. I have sacrificed a piece of my physical self to buy a moment of global clarity. I pick up my satchel. I don't look back at the ouroboros on the wall. The serpent has already eaten its tail. I walk out of the hall, the grey ash from my sleeve leaving a trail on the floor that no Sanitizer will ever be able to scrub away. The Signal doesn't just cut out. It Echo-Resonates. The Samizdat relays in the tunnels don't just transmit the file; they become 'Decryption-Seeds.' The Aria-fragment I leaked begins to pulse through the Academy's own power-lines, a harmonic frequency that bypasses the Aegis filters by mimicking the sound of 'Institutional Gossip.'Lower Dormitory Archives — 03:24 AM
The clerical nook is barely larger than a coffin, the air thick with the smell of scorched parchment and the low-frequency hum of illegal scry-mirrors. Junior archivist Keira Thorne watches as Bodhi Rao’s face—distorted by the Auditor’s cracked lens—pivots toward her. She knows she’s witnessing a Class-I felony in real-time. She should hit the 'Purge-Sigil.' She should notify the Dean. Instead, she chews her thumb-nail until it bleeds, the metallic taste of her own blood grounding her against the building's rising panic. "He's bypassing the primary lattice," she whispers, her fingers flying across a slab of unauthorized 'Grey-Quartz.' "He's not using a broadcast signal. He's using a Phaseless Resonance."
Outside her nook, she hears the heavy, rhythmic thud of armored boots. The Regulators are conducting a wing-by-wing sweep. The 'Corrective-Wards' are already flaring crimson in the hallways. "Come on," she breathes, hitting SAVE OFFLINE. The command doesn't just store data; it closes a 'Mana-Circuit.' She feels a sharp, electric jolt—a spark of Bodhi's own entropy—leap from the slab and into her palm. Her skin turns a faint, translucent violet. The revolutionary payload isn't just information; it's a seed of 'Subtractive Will.' She recognizes the precedent now. This isn't just a rant; it's a 'Resurrection-Sigil' for a truth she thought was dead. "Report this," she mutters as the interface coughs a terminal warning. She slides the slab into a lead-lined pocket and slips out into the shadows of the laundry-shoots, her heart drumming a staccato of defiance against the institution's order. Archivist Vault, Sub‑Basilica Vaticanus — 04:01 AM
The vault is a subterranean cathedral of cold basalt and flickering 'Virtue-Lamps.' Seven hundred leagues east, Cardinal‑Technician Giovanni Dell’Aquila adjusts his spectacles, leaning so close to the monitor that the 'Entropy-Static' from the Signal makes the lenses of his glasses crack. An alarm rune blooms saffron on his monitor. POTENTIAL DOCTRINAL BREACH – THAUMIC UNLICENSED // SOURCE: UNKNOWN_ORIGIN.
"Entropy as sacrament," Giovanni murmurs, his voice rich with a Latin lilt that sounds like aging wine. "Ex nihilo nihil fit… out of nothing, nothing comes. Yet this boy suggests the void is not a lack, but a fuel."
He looks at his espresso cup—a fragile, hand-painted piece of porcelain with a chip at the rim. As Bodhi’s 'Ugly Admissions' resonate through the vault, the cup doesn't just crack. It Shatters into a thousand geometric shards that hang suspended in the air. The Signal Rune is interacting with the vault’s own 'Stasis-Wards,' turning the room into a conceptual battlefield. "The dogma is a cage," Giovanni realizes, his hand hovering over the 'Purge' button. "But the spirit... the spirit is a hurricane."
He doesn't purge. He duplicates the file into a hidden partition labeled ADVOCATUS DIABOLI, then routes a secondary copy into the Vatican's 'Deep-Sovereign' backup-chain. By dawn, the Cardinals would find a new gospel waiting in their morning briefs—one that didn't require a tithe.Copper‑Coin Forum Hub, Lagos — 04:37 AM
The shipping container is submerged in the brackish waters of the Lagoon, cooled by the constant, rhythmic ebb and flow of the tide. Adaeze "Byte‑Lion" Okoye isn't looking at the screen. She’s waist-deep in a slurry of mana-waste and seawater, her hands physical-patching a series of High-Frequency Sigil-Repeaters into the city's desalination grid. "Wake up, you lazy ghosts," she growls, chewing a spicy plantain chip as the container hums with a power-surge that defies the local Regulator-meters. Rao's voice—jagged, raw, unfiltered—vibrates through her conductive bone-headphones. It’s not a broadcast; it’s a 'Payload.' She sees the desalination vents in the harbor begin to glow with a faint, unlicensed violet light. The Signal Rune is providing the 'Aetheric Scaffolding' the city's illegal clinics have been begging for. "Three hundred creds says the Overseers can't find the leak before the whole city wakes up empowered," she mutters. She keys in a 'Mirror-Node' command, fingers slick with salt and mana. "Let's see the Archons try to tax a resonance."
Syndicate Safehouse, Western Freeport — 04:59 AM
The room smells of expensive tobacco and cheap gun-oil. Pietro Sarti sits in the shadows, his service pistol disassembled into twenty-four perfect, clinical pieces on a velvet mat. The secure pager on his belt vibrates. SIGNAL DETECTED – FREQUENCY: WILD-RAO. Pietro doesn't move his eyes from the firing pin he's polishing. But he listens. He hears Bodhi's admissions of theft and God-complexes. He hears the sound of a man who has run out of bridges to burn. "He's articulate," Pietro observes, his voice a flat, dangerous monotone. "But more importantly, he's a Tactical Leak."
By watching Bodhi's 'Cordon Bypass,' Pietro is mapping the signatures of the Academy's internal security-grid. The boy is teaching a world of thieves how to break into the bank. "Boss," Pietro speaks into a encrypted comms-unit. "The asset is no longer a medic. He's a 'Siege-Engine.' He's just handed every syndicate on the coast a skeleton key to the Academy's auxiliary vaults."
Regulator Skimmer Feeds — 05:12 AM
On a floating citadel of polished basalt high above the North Atlantic, Colonel Mira Tan stands perfectly still at the center of the command-pit. Her reflection in the glass floor is a study in controlled iron. "Report status on the Cauterization," she says. "Ineffective, Colonel!" a lieutenant shouts over the sound of a dozen alarm-runes. "The resonance is 'Sub-Net.' It's traveling through the maintenance conduits. It's mimicry-logic—it looks like the Academy's own internal gossip-stream."
Mira watches the global map. The Signal isn't just spreading; it's 'Warping' the localized magic grids. In Lagos, the desalination plants are running at 140% efficiency without an authorized catalyst. In the Vatican, the stasis-wards are failing. "It's a heavy-water leak," Mira says, her voice tight. "He's flooding the basement and letting the pressure do the work. He's not trying to win an argument; he's trying to drown the building."
She looks at Rao’s sweating, desperate face on the primary screen. "Clever," she murmurs. "Initiate the Physical Cordon-Strike on Hall C. We don't burn the Net. We burn the stone."
Back in Lecture Hall C, the Auditor-orb falls to the floor with a hollow metallic clang. Its lenses are cracked; its red glyph is dark. I exit the Hall not through the doors, but through the Sanitizer Chutes—a series of vertical chutes used for mana-waste disposal. I slide into the dark, the scent of lilac and ozone trailing behind me like a ghost. I exit the eastern gate as the first grey light of dawn touches the Academy’s spires. My coat collar is up against the freezing wind, my left hand tucked into a pocket to hide the drifting ash of my own identity. Behind me, the Academy is alive with sirens and the rhythmic thud of a physical strike-team. Beyond that, the city is beginning to 'Resonate.'I haven't saved the world. I've just broken the seal on the poison. I walk toward the Badlands, entirely aware that the world I knew belongs to the ash.]]></description><link>manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-04-draft.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Projects/Writing/Books/The Cleric Saga/_bmad-output/manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-04-draft.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:17:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[chapter-03-draft]]></title><description><![CDATA[
[AUDIO FRAGMENT: FILE_CORRUPT_07 // SOURCE: VIRAL_FEED] Magic’s just belief that bites back. And like belief, it’s never neutral - it’s loaded, cultural, political, and pissed off. Magic allowed Mages to turn gods into mana batteries, worshipping into spell prep. Let me guess - you thought magic had no borders. That it was some sort of universal force, accessible to all, pure and egalitarian, like sunlight or gravity or Spotify Premium. Cute. The reality? The world’s been chopped into 77 magical nation-states, each one with its own spells, gods, taxes, and geopolitical tantrums. Magic isn’t free - it’s franchised. And trust me, the global magical order runs about as smoothly as a three-legged centaur on cobblestones. The most powerful states - Vaticanus, Avalon, Nihon - hoard relics like dragons and rewrite the rules of reality from gilded parliamentary sanctums while the rest of us sweat through spellwork for minimum enchantment. Magical privilege is real. Healers like me? We’re the magical working class. We pour our lifeblood into mending wounds while some state-sponsored Illuminatus in a runic robe gets tenure for levitating spoons.
I live in the North Atlantic Magic Federation, or NAMF - and no, the acronym doesn’t get any cooler with time. Imagine if Silicon Valley went to Burning Man, read three books on Indigenous spirituality, then tried to run a government. That’s NAMF. A hyper-technocratic patchwork of mana grids, bureaucratic mysticism, and chakra-branding startups with names like "SoulSync." They gentrified magic. Here, shamanic rituals get repackaged as "neural field recalibration experiences," and ancestral spells are copyrighted by hedge-funded AlchemTech firms. It’s appropriation with an expense report. And the worst part? They think they fixed magic - standardized it, regulated it, made it safe for public use. But they didn’t. They just made it palatable to the colonizers. Every nation practices its own flavor of the arcane - from Celtic Druidry to Zoroastrian Firecraft - but NAMF acts like it invented the wheel because it gave it Bluetooth. Meanwhile, they still ignore the fact that the borders of these magical states were drawn with blood, theft, and bureaucratic quills by the same empires that once stole gods and named them "myths." Magic isn’t a gift. It’s a history. And in this world, history’s got landlords.
The corridor leading to the tribunal looks like it was carved by someone who hated angles. Every surface sweeps in soft cathedral arches—no corners for paranoia to roost, no shadows deep enough to hide contrition. Runic sconces glow in sterile amber, their light filtered through suppression glyphs that taste of copper on the tongue. Two Regulators flank me, batons cradled in practiced indifference. My cuffs have been replaced by a braided chain-hex—pretty, platinum, horrendously expensive. It hums against my wrist with the smug tenor of old money.Note to self: Invoice the Council for accessorizing. Labor isn’t cheap.Ahead, the doors loom. Twin titans of rune-laced lunastone, inlaid with the Academy’s crest—Serpens Ouroboros devouring its tail around a stylized caduceus. The message is simple: everything feeds the institution eventually, even itself. As I cross the threshold a chill sluices down my spine, equal parts climate control and psychological conditioning. I step onto obsidian that reflects me in broken prisms—fractured Bodhi multiplied, each shard a different mistake. The room smells of ozone and the gut-hollow lightness of huge, empty spaces designed to make you feel small.The chamber proper is a vertical coliseum flipped inside‑out. Instead of spectators, tiered balconies hold mosaic panels depicting legendary miracles: Saint Torin closing plague‑sores with a hymn; High‑Cherurg Tenebris suturing reality to stop a dimensional bleed. All executed in luminous tesserae that shift color when you blink. I count twelve elders stationed around a horseshoe dais, each perched behind a half‑moon pulpit of orichalcum lattice. Their robes are winter‑storm gray, a color patented by the Academy to denote unassailable authority™.Suspension wards shimmer overhead—concentric discs of frozen starlight rotating at contemplative speed. They leach magic from the air in lazy siphons, the way bored aristocrats drain champagne flutes. My tattoos prickle under the drag, entropy wards sighing like exhausted lungs.A clerk in waist-coat and levitating quill reads charges that dance holographically between us: UNLICENSED MIRACLE-WORKING. RECKLESS THAUMATURGY. DAMAGE TO MUNICIPAL WARDS. Then the sub-headers scroll, the fine print that actually ruins you: Immediate Licensure Revocation. Retroactive Debt Bondage for Academy Tuition. Permanent Blacklisting from NAMF Territories. The words crackle, then evaporate into faint motes that settle on my shoulders like ash.
"Defendant, state your full name for the record."
"State it? Note the record says 'Defendant,' so let's save time. Bodhisunya Rao. Friends call me Bodhi. You can call me 'The Reason Your Grid Didn't Melt'."
A ripple of disapproval races the balconies. Good—wouldn’t want anyone getting comfortable. Looking up at the "Council of Porcelain Masks", I scan the horseshoe dais for the Primary Speakers. Center stage is Arch-Elder Virelia Mournwright, skin like bleached parchment stretched over old fury, nose pinched by pince-nez that double as a rune scanner. To her right sits Elder Magistrate Cleon Astell, financier turned ethicist, his robe pin adorned with the sigil of the Chamber of Commerce because even hypocrisy needs branding. And on the far left... Elder-Healer Saanvi Belgaran. The only genuine clinician present. Her eyes are rimmed crimson—sleepless nights or suppressed empathy, hard to tell.The rest form an equal‑opportunity mural of disdain—administrators, philanthropist backers, two politicians who arrived late and smell faintly of after‑banquet mead. Seeing Elder Saanvi sitting amongst the Judiciaries causes my throat to tighten. The guilt hits me then—not a feeling, but a physical weight, like swallowing a stone. Saanvi was not only a personal mentor of mine at the Academy, but my mother's best friend. Disappointing her wasn't on the agenda.Virelia leans forward, hands steepled. "Mr. Rao, the Council appreciates your… enthusiasm for patient safety. However, your methodology raises grave concerns. You performed a Class IV Sub-Resurrection Causal Inversion within an unsanctioned Null Field. Alone."
"Correct. I also didn't wait for a committee to vote on gravity while the kid fell. Minor miracle that I managed to avoid spilling coffee on my white coat. If we're listing irrelevant facts."
Cleon’s jaw flexes. "Flippancy will not serve you here."
"Yeah, well neither will appeasement."
Saanvi interjects, voice brittle but weighted with something heavier than annoyance. "The Entropy indices recorded a seventeen‑point escalation. You claim to have controlled a Class 4 Paradox with willpower, Bodhi. That is not science; it is delusion. The Ward Lattice was already destabilized by the Lunar transit. Your 'miracle' nearly triggered a cascade failure across the entire eastern seaboard. You didn't just risk yourself. You risked everyone."
I nod, the humor draining out of my posture. "I know the math, Saanvi. But the math doesn't scream when it bleeds out."
A few students in the upper mezzanine—allowed to observe for pedagogical value—stifle laughs before tutors glare them silent.Virelia raps a gavel of moon‑silver. The sound is soft yet final, like a guillotine cushioned with velvet. "Explain your spellwork. In detail."
I unspool it. How Standard Regeneration forces cellular genesis forward—too slow for a pulmo‑hemorrhagic collapse. How Time Reversal bends causality but drags surrounding reality like a toddler’s blanket, risking wide‑area paradox. How both require umpteen practitioners chanting in key while the patient’s life bleeds out a metronome. My method? Entropy drag.
"You treat injuries as open thermodynamic systems," I say, pacing within my hex‑radius. "Force the wound state to trade entropy with the Null Field. Body moves toward lower‑entropy configuration—aka healthy—while the field uptakes the disorder. The trick is establishing a fuse."
Cleon sneers. "Spare us the poetry, Mr. Rao. The actuarial tables don't care about your 'tricks'. The Null Field collapsed twenty‑three seconds post‑procedure."
"Because I was the fuse, Cleon. If the field collapsed, it would have imploded me, not the ward. I did the math. I just didn't factor in your comfort levels. Zero civilian casualties, unless you count my career. But that was terminal anyway."
Astell turns plum. "Irrelevant. You circumvented every safety protocol to flaunt your—"
"—to save a kid abandoned by protocol," I cut in. My voice echoes, riding the chamber’s perfect acoustics. "Had I waited for your four‑thaumiphysician choir, she’d be a chalk outline."
Murmurs bubble. Virelia raises her hand and the room stills. "Intent does not absolve recklessness. Doctrine exists to harness power for the common good."
I laugh, short and crooked. "Doctrine exists to gatekeep the divine. If good were common we wouldn’t price it by the hour."
A sub‑clerk hovers a scroll‑slab toward me. Case histories flicker: Alcester v. The Collective, Van‑Luik Reversal Incident, each a cautionary tale of lone mages who cooked themselves alive attempting entropy inversion. My favorite bedtime stories.Virelia taps the scroll. "These tragedies prove why quorum is mandatory."
"They prove why the quorum of cowards is lethal," I reply. "Every one of those med‑teams refused to act until they formed a committee. People died waiting for a vote that never closed."
Saanvi’s eyes flutter shut. She’s seen the same corpses. Cleon arches a brow, scenting weakness in his colleague.
"Elder Belgaran, perhaps you’d like to remind the defendant of the stable miracles ratio?"
She exhales. "Three practitioners minimize entropy feedback by distributing metabolic cost across synced circulatory matrices—"
"—Unless one practitioner is me," I interrupt. "My vitals remain within tolerance post‑spell." I hold out my hands, palms up. "No necrotic bloom. No fissured aura. Check the telemetry."
A holographic panel materializes mid‑air, courtesy of the Regulator medic who processed me. My biosign curves glide across in neat sine waves. Heart rate elevated but steady; entropy saturation at 62%—ugly but survivable.Saanvi frowns at the data, torn between disbelief and grudging respect. Cleon overrides. "Even if you withstood it, you jeopardized the ward lattice. We had to divert power from neonatal stasis rooms to reinforce the grid. Three infants nearly de-synced because you wanted to play god with a gunshot wound."
I bite back a retort about billable priorities. Instead I pivot.
"The patient lives."
The statement hangs like incense. No one responds. Truth rarely needs allies; it just needs air.A hush falls so complete I swear I hear dust motes pirouette. In that pause my gaze drifts upward, past suppression discs, to stained‑glass oculi depicting The First Miracle: a robed figure splitting darkness with light. I wonder what tribunal he faced afterward.Heat stings behind my eyes—unexpected, unwelcome. I channel it into words.
"My mother died in a ward ten meters from here," I say softly. "Tumor the size of regret in her frontal lobe. Academy surgeons called it economically non‑viable to attempt Class&nbsp;III excision. You signed that letter, Arch‑Elder."
Virelia blinks once, the only crack in her alabaster mask.
"You conflate policy with—"
"I conflate policy with hypocrisy." The admission tastes like rust. "So when a girl rolled into that alley with her lungs sautéed, I saw my mother’s ghost telling me to break the rules that broke her."
No one meets my eyes. Good. Let guilt crowd their retinas.Elder Technocrat Imir Solvan, silent until now, adjusts his neural halo—thin ring of light mapping mind to archive.
"Mr. Rao, your incantation contained an anomalous glyphic sub-routine: ThRun-kel Tuu Vaar'lenna. Translation lost to public lexicons. Where did you obtain it?"
Ah, there it is—the real hunt.
"My grandmother’s prayer book," I lie smoothly. "A bedtime benediction for unruly weather. Old family superstition."
The lie settles heavy in my gut. I’m not just hiding a technique; I’m hiding Her. If they knew Saint Nalini was dabbling in Atavistic Entropy—messing with forces that could unzip the city—her statue in the atrium would be rubble by morning.Imir’s halo stutters. He knows I’m bluffing. The ring of light abruptly contracts, tightening around his temples like a vice, casting a targeting reticle over his left eye. He leans forward, the light burning hot enough to smell like ozone. He knows. But proving it would require a deep-dive scan that overrides tribunal protocol. He slowly relaxes the halo, accepting the convenient fiction, but the threat remains scorched into the air. Better a reckless student than a corrupted legend.Virelia signals the dais. A translucent veil descends, muting their voices while they deliberate. From my position I watch their silhouettes mime outrage, concern, self‑preservation—an interpretive dance of bureaucracy. It hits me then, watching them argue not about if I should be expelled, but how. They aren't expelling me because I failed. They're expelling me because I worked. Because I used "impossible" magic to fix a problem their perfect System declared unsolvable. If I can rewrite entropy without their permission, what else can I do? I am a variable they cannot isolate, an irregularity in their perfect equation.Above, suppression discs slow, as if the room itself holds its breath.Minutes stretch origami-long. Students whisper; quills scratch; somewhere a regulator pops gum. I roll my shoulders. The hex-chain loosens a millimeter—enough to remind me entropy favors change. I could snap it, maybe. Melt through the suppression grid, sprint for the corridor. But that would undermine the point: the guilty should not need to run.The veil rises.Virelia stands, gavel poised but not yet struck. "The Council finds the defendant—"
A hush funnels every heartbeat into my ears. I see Saanvi’s lips tremble, Cleon’s nostrils flare, Imir’s halo spin.
"—in violation of Articles 7, 12, and 19. Sentencing to be pronounced following procedural ratification by the Internal Safety Review Board at oh‑six‑hundred."
So they kick the can to sunrise. Bureaucracy’s favorite alarm clock.
Cleon adds, "In the interim, you remain in custody under probationary suspension."Regulators move to escort me. I smirk. "Guess I’m trending."
Before they guide me out, Saanvi catches my eye. She looks at the empty seat beside me—where my mother would have sat—then back to me. It's not confusion in her face; it's the grief of watching potential incinerate itself. She mouths a single word: why?
I tap my chest twice—heartbeat, hope—and let the question hang unanswered. She thinks I threw it all away. She doesn't understand that I'm the only one keeping the inheritance safe.
"I'll also accept 'Your Majesty' or 'Papa' if the first one feels too formal," I mutter under my breath, but the joke is ash in my mouth. It lands with a dull thud, protecting nothing.
As the doors seal behind me, the last thing I see is Virelia polishing her gavel like a trophy hunter buffing ivory.The corridor greets me again, colder now. I breathe in recycled air heavy with cleansing aether and taste tomorrow’s judgment. Somewhere, the healed girl inhales too—lungs unscarred because I dared entropy to a duel. No council verdict can rewrite that equation. I saved her.The thought crystallizes, sharp as the sigil drying on my palm. My resolve anneals in the furnace of official disdain. If the system thinks suspension will temper me, it misunderstands metallurgy: some alloys harden under fire.I let the Regulators lead me toward holding—but my shadow stretches ahead, carving a path toward whatever rebellion waits at dawn.
[AUDIO FRAGMENT: FILE_CORRUPT_08 // SOURCE: VIRAL_FEED] People love to act like all mages are created equal - just a bunch of robe-wearing wand-wavers doing cool hand signs and quoting Latin. But the truth? The magical world is as stratified, smug, and stupidly hierarchical as everything else. Doesn’t matter how many spells you know or how many times you’ve saved someone’s life - your title says more about your bank account than your talent. Everyone wants to be a Sorcerer. No one wants to be a Cleric. Then there are five types of magic so far above our paygrade, they get capital letters: Creation, Spacetime, Truth, all that divine jazz. No one has seen those for the better part of 2 millennia. We call them the Five Divinities, because calling them "completely inaccessible plot devices" didn’t test well with the clergy. Supposedly, they were once wielded by god-tier magi who could rewrite existence, undo causality, and speak lies so true they became fact. These days? They’re more myth than method - classified, forbidden, or just plain extinct. But hey, if you ever meet someone who can conjure uranium or rewind time, run. Or bow. Maybe both.
So let’s break it down: *Sorcerers: Born with it. Magical bloodlines. Intuitive and arrogant.*
*Wizards: Learned it. Walk encyclopedias. Paranoid control freaks.*
*Warlocks: Borrowed it. Made a deal. Definitely overcompensating.*
*Druids: Channel it. Tree huggers with superiority complexes.*
*Clerics: Heal it. Soul surgeons who think band-aids are for cowards.* I’m a Cleric. Which is a fancy way of saying I went to med school for magic and came out with a PhD in patching up people dumb enough to set themselves on fire. My mom’s a Sorceress. Healing runs in our family - not power, just responsibility. You think ER docs have it hard? Try doing trauma surgery with your soul. Magic doesn’t just fix the body. It forces it back into shape. And every time we do it, a little piece of us goes missing. You'd think that would earn me some respect. Maybe money. Some pity at least. Nah.
I sit at the bottom of the magical caste system, somewhere between "unpaid intern" and "miracle janitor." Nobody wants to talk about the politics of magic, but it’s everywhere. Thaumaturgy is treated like a hard science because it sounds like math. Theurgy gets funding because it invokes gods. Spellcasting? That’s the "Just Add Fireball" crowd. Meanwhile, my field - Healing Magic - is seen as passive, feminine, imprecise. Never mind the fact that I’m rewiring souls and stitching minds together with my bare aura. That doesn’t make headlines. It just makes survivors. But sure, let's keep pretending that magical academia isn’t shaped by the same classist, racist, colonial rot as everything else.
The head elder’s gavel isn’t made of wood. It’s wrenched from something older—petrified dragon‑bone inlaid with antimony runes that glint like collapsed stars. When it descends, the crack isn’t sound; it’s pressure, a micro‑quake shivering air, marrow, memory. Wards stitched into the vaulted ceiling flare, swallowing the vibration before it can bruise the gold‑lined frescoes. Justice must never dent the décor.
"By unanimous decree," intones Elder Virelia, voice smoothed by centuries of acceptable outrage, "Bodhisunya Rao is hereby placed on indefinite suspension pending further review. Effective immediately. All associated privileges, peripherals, and accreditations are rescinded. Assets held by the Academy Bank are frozen to offset ward damages."
Indefinite. The syllables hit like wet cement—slow, heavy, irreversible once set. I catalogue the council faces out of spite: Virelia’s alabaster serenity; Cleon's twitching left eye (expensive nerve tonic, ironically); Saanvi's fingers fussing with an invisible ledger only she can see, trying her hardest not to meet my eyeline. Not one of them looks relieved. No, relief would imply risk, empathy, shared consequence. What I register gleaming behind their polite masks is simpler: administrative closure.Somewhere beyond the dais, the spectral scribe‑orb hovers, whirring as it etches the ruling into transmutable crystal. A new entry for the Academy archives, filed between Dormitory Fire, 241 AE and Alchemical Plague Inquiry, 243 AE. My name will glow there in neat rune‑font, a cautionary subheading: Violation: Unauthorized Miracle‑work, Null‑Field Causality Reversal.
"Do you understand the council’s verdict?" Cleon asks, ritual words echoing off pillars the width of ancestral guilt.
My tongue could choose tact—or it could pick the lock on their composure. I flex broken knuckles and decide I’m done with tact.
"Crystal," I answer, smiling just wide enough to weaponize a molar‑chip. "Though given the Academy’s fondness for crystal, maybe you should etch it on my forehead. Easier for the next patrol to scan."
Gasps ripple from the mezzanine where junior archivists cluster like flightless ravens. One drops a rune‑slate; it clatters, the noise swallowed by an acoustic damping field quicker than shame. Cleon’s eyelids shutter half‑mast—a palace guard ignoring a jester’s stool joke—and he pivots to the procedural finale.
"Place your left hand upon the Suppression Sigil."
A podium rises from the marble dais, silent as guilt, revealing a recessed plate of cold electrum inscribed with a living ward. Filaments writhe across its surface, searching for a pulse to devour. I plant my hand without ceremony. The sigil flares, scans, condemns.A terse chime. Then the systematic unthreading begins.My coat—a battered grey long‑line, regulation cut but riddled with illicit stitch‑sigils—reacts first. The chest pocket, once proud with a triad of badges, spasms like flesh meeting acid.click‑tchhh— The Clerical Adept Crest pops loose, detaches, and hovers a heartbeat before drifting toward the podium’s receiving halo. The Medical Discipline Glyph follows, its serpent‑and‑chalice icon shedding cobalt sparks as authorization sigils erase themselves mid‑air. Last is the Field Supplicant Seal, earned during a charity plague ward two winters ago; it trembles, reluctant, then rips itself free, tearing a neat square of fabric as it goes.Three emblems spin in lazy orbit above the Suppression Sigil, cooling slag to my smolder. They dissolve into light—the Academy reclaiming invested thaumic capital as efficiently as a loan shark cracking kneecaps for interest.The theft leaves phantom weight on my chest, like bandages torn from a half-healed burn. It hurts—a sharp, tearing deeper than skin. I’m lighter, yes—but raw, nerves open to the chill exhaled by marble saints perched around the rotunda. I inhale that cold, let it plate the ache in iron, and meet Cleon’s gaze.
"Satisfied? Or do you need my spine too?"
No reply. But I see a twitch—a fractional tightening near his brow as the chamber wards record my insolence. Let them. Every syllable is another splinter under their lacquer‑polished ethics.The session adjourns. Elders rise in synchronized exhaustion, a murmuration of ivory robes rustling like dry parchment. They descend side aisles to private lifts, refusing to pass me directly—as if suspension is contagious demon‑pox.Court recorders deactivate scry‑orbs and collapse quill stands. Spectators file out, heads bowed, boots silent on ward‑hushed stone. Some cast sideways pity‑glances; others look right through me, calibrating optics for an inconvenient ghost. I don’t flinch until I catch the hazel stare of Fenya Sokolov—second‑year Rune Pathologist, debate partner, friend in better hours. She holds my gaze a full two seconds, lips parted with words she’ll never risk. Then she pivots, cloak flaring like a coward’s white flag.Fine.For a moment the chamber empties, the hush so complete I can hear my blood choreographing revenge between heartbeats. Then he appears. A boy no older than twelve slides from behind a pillar, clutching something in both fists. Regulation uniform two sizes too big, knees scabbed, eyes ringed in feverish gratitude. Recognition kicks in. The girl’s brother.
His voice is a library whisper: "Mister Rao?"
I drop to a squat, level with his terror. Up close I see dried blood in his hair—someone tried to clean him up and ran out of time.
"That’s me," I say, trying not to sound like the cellblock reaper. "Your sister holding steady?"
He nods enough to rattle bones. "They moved her to Intensive Miracle Ward. The doctors said… they said she shouldn’t be breathing, but she is. Because of you."
I want to smile but the muscles misfire. He extends a crumpled scrap of paper—Academy prescription pad torn corner, ink smeared by sweat and hope. I unfold it:
THANK YOU — scrawled in looped child letters. Beneath, a shaky glyph: a phoenix feather entwined with the null sign. The improvised rune for second chances.My throat closes. All the snark, all the polished cynicism, gone useless against this guerrilla gratitude. I tuck the note inside my sleeve where badges used to be.
"Tell her she owes me for the—" The joke dissolves. I try again. "Tell her… I’m still on call. If she needs me."
He swallows, salutes in sloppy imitation of arrival drills, and scurries toward public egress before regulators notice him. His footfalls fade, but the warmth he left stings hotter than ward‑burns.A new figure approaches: Superintendent Helene Draxis, steward of disciplinary facilities, reputation forged from tungsten and final notices. She carries a crystal tablet showing logistics: escort rotation, asset reclamation, restricted corridor clearance. Her gaze sweeps the room, verifying the emptiness before she addresses me.
"Rao, you are to vacate Academy grounds within the hour. Dormitory access revoked. Library credentials purged. Per code 117-B you may retrieve personal effects under supervision. Formal sentencing will be ratified at 0600. Until then, you are an unperson."
I stand, coat flapping ragged where badges used to anchor it.
"Does per code 117‑B include a farewell parade? Balloons? Maybe a marching band in minor key?"
She stares as if parsing a dialect she once knew and forgot on purpose. "Your humor is a waste of time."
"This whole thing is a waste of time, look around you." I gesture at the deserted benches, the rune‑scarred podium still tasting my DNA.
"Do we need an escort to the gate, or will the walls move for me?"
"The walls," she says, monotone as a null field, "are not your concern. Two regulators will accompany you."
She flicks her wrist; behind her, a pair of crimson‑armored sentries peel from shadow, wands holstered but hands tense.
Regulators again. Full circle. Cosmic joke.Draxis turns to leave, stops, and without facing me asks, "Was it worth it?"
There it is—the question everyone pretends is rhetorical. I check the sleeve pocket where fragile paper presses my pulse.
"Every magicked‑up minute."
She exhales through nostrils, either disdain or reluctant respect—I can’t read the signature. Then she walks. The regulators flank me.We exit through Processional Exit Hallway&nbsp;E, a rabbit warren designed more for ceremony than traffic efficiency: Corinthian columns, azurite mosaics depicting sanitized miracles, chandeliers forged from salvaged phoenix ash. Everything screams victory lap, but tonight the corridor is a morgue in holiday lights.My boots echo. The regulators’ boots refuse to—sound dampened by hushwards, because silence enforces dignity.Halfway down the passage a flock of first‑years waits, jittering. They part like water around an oil spill, avoiding eye contact. One whispers, "That’s him," another mutters, "Null-field butcher."
The nickname ricochets inside my skull—brand new, already rusting.
I keep walking.At the corridor’s midpoint stands a statue of Madame Rehka Lyra, the Academy’s patron saint of sanctioned resilience. Bronze robes flow in alchemical perpetuity. She cradles an hourglass; inside, infinitesimal stardust resets every sixty seconds—a reminder that time, like policy, can be bent but never broken. Someone has draped a white ribbon around her wrist, symbol of structural mercy. I snort. Even effigies get sympathy.A gust slides through hidden vents, fluttering my coat hem, stirring the still‑bleeding tear where badges were evicted. The fabric whispers against itself, almost shaping words.At the ornate arch marking the transition from tribunal wing to dormitory‑spine, my escorts halt. They confer silently—one projects a hologlyph verifying transfer; the other adjusts sonic cuffs clipped to his belt. A warded turnstile looms ahead, currently dormant but hungry.
"Retrieve your belongings," the taller regulator says. He holds up a scanner. "We monitor. No unexpected artifacts."
I nod, step through the turnstile. It lights up, scanning for contraband miracle residue. The brand on my wrist—a new sigil formed by the suppression spell—pulses, interacting with the gate. For a second I expect alarms, grapples, maybe a humiliating strip search. But the ward recognizes its own handiwork: asset neutralized. A green rune blinks. Passage granted.Dormitory corridor: dim, late, smelling of sweat, ink, and the last days of childhood. My doorplate has already rewritten itself from RAO, B. — CLERICAL TRACK to VACANT – TO BE ASSIGNED. Efficient.Inside, the room is smaller than I remember, but grief always expands interior dimensions. I shove textbooks, arcane notebooks, half‑finished null field equations into a travel satchel. The canvas strains; calculation shards poke through seams. On the nightstand: a holo‑photo of my mother mid‑laughter, pre‑illness, when magic was still bedtime myth. I hesitate, then slip the wafer behind the boy’s note—double‑layered talisman against institutional amnesia.At the closet, my reflection glints off a cracked mirror. Coat torn, eyes sunken, brand glowing sullen violet. The man staring out looks feral but awake.
"Rules be damned," I whisper. The mirror doesn’t argue.
Satchel slung, I return to the corridor where regulators wait like bored gargoyles. We march toward the exit logistics have mapped. Each step scatters the ghosts of conversations, friendships, lectures, debts. Hungry silence devours them before they settle.Finally, a T‑junction. Left leads to administration egress and the world beyond. Right leads deeper inside—to academic spires, relic halls, lecture theaters. My escorts steer left.But halfway through the pivot, I stop.Because from the depths of Corridor&nbsp;Delta a light flickers—old gaslamp alley glow, impossible inside this palace of sanctioned lumens. It beats like a pulse, a dare. And I remember: Ghost‑Lit Corridors wait. Vitrines. Statues. A private zero‑hour pilgrimage to mock saints and mourn badges.
"I need the restroom," I say.
The regulators exchange glances—regulation code allows biological breaks. One points left toward public washrooms. I point right. "These pipes," I lie, "don’t play nice with null field burns. There’s a med‑niche past the reliquary. Two minutes."
They hesitate. Then the scanner beeps—flatline normal. They checked me for active magic and found nothing because I'm suppressing my own signature. Their overconfidence is their blind spot. I layer exhaustion across my shoulders, add a tremor to my hand. Permission granted with curt nods.I walk right. I don’t hurry—that would trigger pursuit. But inside, my pulse drumming a war cadence, narrative gravity pivots.Each step away from egress is a step toward something else—Ghost‑Lit Corridors, vitrines of legendary healers, the roaring silence of icons who saved like I did but with permission slips. My destination unfurls ahead: a shadowed artery no longer patrolled at classroom hours.Behind me, regulators remain silhouettes at the edge of ward light, giving the illusion of trust. Good. They don’t know I’m already forging a new badge from resolve and spite.At the mouth of the reliquary hall I pause. I take the crumpled note from my sleeve, feel its soft rebellion whisper live. Tuck it near my heart. Straighten coat torn open for new mythologies.I step forward, into gloom lit by relic glow, leaving suspension verdicts to fossilize behind me. They took my badges. They couldn't take the hands that earned them. I kept those, if not the dignity of title or station. If I left, I left with clean hands in my pockets and my gaze level with theirs.]]></description><link>manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-03-draft.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Projects/Writing/Books/The Cleric Saga/_bmad-output/manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-03-draft.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:17:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[chapter-02-draft]]></title><description><![CDATA[
[AUDIO FRAGMENT: FILE_CORRUPT_04 // SOURCE: VIRAL_FEED]
...look, maybe I should back up. Definitions matter. The old guard wants you to think Magic is some mystical favor from the Gods. Screw that.
By-and-large, the magical world is wrapped up in the same veneer of Civility as the Mundane. And to the detriment of all involved, is entrenched in the same level of bureaucracy, hypocrisy, and corruption.
But I digress!
...where was I?
Right. "Magic." Wrong. Magic follows laws. Conservation, Entropy, Flux, Displacement. It has principles just like physics. It’s just... messier. Less Newton, more Schrödinger. Magic is a science, like anything else. Understand this: everything that exists in our reality, exists within the confines of the Rules of Reality. Just because something does not fit into our understanding of the world, does not mean it violates it.
Some time in the 40s, a few magically inclined physicists came to a conclusion that would have turned the World on its head, if the information wasn't surpressed. At its core, Magic is the fifth fundamental force of the universe. Right up there with gravity and whatever it is that keeps your atoms from vibing out of existence. Except this one has an on-again/off-again relationship with order and loves loopholes.
There’s a whole ass list of magical laws. Thermodynamic knockoffs. Newtonian reboots. Gauss with jazz hands. We call ‘em the 12 Laws of Thaumaturgy. They matter - but only if you plan on living through spellcasting. Magic displaces reality. Literally. It creates a void where the laws of physics collapse and new rules can take over. Think of it as reality having a panic attack. Physics takes five, and Magic strolls in with a Venti double espresso and a grudge. If reality were a bathtub, Magic is your favorite "'bubber' ducky". It "displaces" the water around it. We call that duck the Thaumaturgic Field. It’s everywhere. It permeates every atom, molecule, and soul. It’s carried by particles we call Thaumions - basically quantum middle fingers to the Standard Model. And trust me, they’re real. We’ve measured them. Every spell ripples through the Thaumaturgic Field like a fart in a wind tunnel - invisible to those without the "gift", but undeniably real. Thank the thaumions for that.
Frosted steel bites. My wrists sing the bruise‑colored hymn they started rehearsing the moment the rune‑cuffs first locked, each note sharper than the last. A crimson‑armored Regulator nudges me forward with the flat of his warded baton. The corridor ahead is iced in thaumic blue, ceiling‑mounted auric strips thrumming like hive wings. The air tastes of antiseptic pine and latent ozone— the Academy’s signature perfume for don’t touch, don’t breathe, comply. I check the strip's pulse rate out of habit; 60Hz. Standard for containment, but the yellow undertone means the backup generators are cycling. Sloppy.Beneath the hum of the pumps, a speaker system plays a distorted, time-stretched loop of "Toxic" by Britney Spears, retuned to 432Hz for "maximum patient pacification." It’s working; a violent calm settles over me.I shuffle past a security panel, wincing as the decontamination mist hits the gash on my left eyebrow. Dried blood pulls tight—an ironic tilak, paired with the entropy‑scar constellations glowing a timid violet beneath my skin. Great. I probably look like a discounted saint in the clearance aisle.
"Step," the Regulator drones, voice modulated through a brass half‑mask etched with anti‑contagion sigils. His partner raises a palm, rune‑plate flaring, and a transparent containment door iris‑spins open. Containment Ward&nbsp;7‑C scrolls in holographic letters across the threshold. Underneath: BIO‑THAUM RISK: SEVERE.Intensive care for inconvenient miracles— that’s what 7‑C is. Where the Academy parks anything or anyone too magically radioactive to mingle with the donor‑banquet crowd upstairs. Today I’m the bleeding‑edge exhibit. My eyes half-close. If they want to treat me like a specimen, I might as well act like one.My boots squeak traitorously on the slippery disinfectant film. Above the ceiling tiles, mana-vacuum pumps whine at a pitch that rattles my teeth—a sub-audible drill into the skull. The air tastes of astringent ethanol layered over burnt rosemary, distinct as a chemical cocktail. Sterility flavored with failed ward incense. Everything is over-lit, over-white; even shadows look laundered here.A pair of articulated arms descend from the ceiling rig the moment I cross the gasket line. They’re chromed, jointed like praying mantis legs, and end in crystal‑studded rings that dilate to encircle my chest. Needle-thin runes of spell-light probe through skin, bone, soul. Focus. Detox first, existential crisis later.I keep my sarcasm on an external monologue setting— easier to file complaints with Reality when you narrate.A phosphorescent diagnostic rune scrolls above me, projecting vitals I don’t need to see: ENTROPY LOAD: 173 μE. PHYS‑ENERGY DEFICIT: −2 800 kcal. SPIRITUAL NOISE: MODERATE. Basically I’m an over‑turned battery leaking acid on the carpet.Automaton Medic&nbsp;#26 glides forward on rail‑wheels embedded in the floor. Humanoid chassis, alabaster fiber‑resin, face a blank porcelain plate with a single runic lens where a nose would be. An aura‑speaker crackles.
"Subject designator Bodhisunya Rao, unlicensed healer. Processing detox protocol D‑441. Hold still."
Hold still, he says, as if the restraining rings haven’t already turned my ribs into compression art. A spray of cold mist envelops my arms— neutralizer aerosol laced with auric chelators. Feels like being dipped in dry ice and shame.
"Friendly PSA," I grit out through clenched teeth. "The patient preference field on your bedside forms says ‘he.’ I’m a student, not a lab rat."
"Detox commencement: 15… 14…13…"
A violet surge ripples across my forearms, entropy wards flaring defensively. The automaton’s sensor registers the spike; mechanical arms ratchet tighter. Tendons creak. Pain booms behind my eyes.The world tilts. For a split second, the pain tastes like mint and the sound of the machine's gears looks like jagged yellow lightning. Synesthesia override. The limiter's kicking in.The protocol runs in three vicious acts:
Thaum‑Ion Extraction: Needle‑thin conduits breach skin, siphoning rogue particles. Each extraction feels like a tiny sun being yanked through capillaries.
Entropy Scrub: Nanoscopic glyphs crawl over my nerves, shaving runaway probabilities back into compliance; every shave is a razor dipped in nostalgia— I relive the alley clinic in flashes: cracked linoleum, girl’s ribs fluttering, sirens screeching.
Limiter Sync: My student ID cuff— the same one that throttled me mid‑spell— is attuned to the mainframe here. It re‑imposes safe‑casting thresholds by burning a brand into the metaphysical equivalent of marrow. The process tastes like burnt cinnamon and regret.
By the time the countdown reaches zero I’m panting, shirt plastered to spine, eyes watering from ozone stench. The automaton retracts its claws.
"Detox complete. Probability deviation reduced to Academy standard. Subject remains bio‑thaum risk due to unstable entropy signatures."
"File it under feature, not a bug," I rasp. My voice rides a raspy, half‑drunk chuckle— more defiance than humor.
The rings detach and retreat into the ceiling. Gravity is obscene without their support; I nearly collapse before my knees catch. Two Regulators step inside, wands leveled—you could slice bread on their righteousness.
"Hands behind—" one starts.
I comply, palms outward, entropy scars still glowing faintly.
"Dude, relax. I’m environmentally friendly now— zero‑emission cleric. Just don’t shake me, you’ll void the warranty."
No laugh. Philistines. They usher me to a magnesium‑polished examination plinth. Every step squeaks. My soles leave watery boot‑prints that evaporate in seconds, devoured by ambient ward‑heat.The medic returns with a tray of opalescent phials. Each is labeled THAUM‑CREDIT ASSESSMENT SAMPLE. A little meter hovers overhead, ticking like a parking clock. Even here— especially here—the ledger rules. The Academy can’t bill me for unauthorized miracle‑working until they quantify exactly how much miracle I leaked onto the alley floor.The automaton unsheathes a humming lancet rune. "Blood and aether sample required for tuition damage appraisal," it explains in a voice blended from two hundred bored bureaucrats. "Failure to comply will result in asset seizure."
"Take a number," I mutter, presenting my forearm. "I’m worth at least four kidneys on the thaum‑organ market. There’s a discount for bulk."
The lancet kisses skin— bright sting, then numb. The phial fills with shimmering, ink‑dark fluid threaded by violet sparks. My blood looks like a night sky in a test tube. Poetic or biohazard? Why not both.The meter chirps and calculates. Projected fine: 89,000 lumens. Lumens— the Federation’s idea of magical fiat currency, pegged to the average mana cost of a Class&nbsp;II shield rune. Eighty‑nine grand for saving a kid. That's three years of Dad's ventilator bills. Or a decade of indentured servitude in the mana mines if I default. My stomach hollows.
"Itemized receipt?" I ask.
Sarcasm is my respirator; inhale at your own risk.
The automaton prints a vellum slip. Services Rendered: Emergency Null‑Field, Unlicensed Regeneration, Municipal Ward Damage (minor), Regulator Deployment (level&nbsp;B mobilization). Below the total: PAYMENT PLAN AVAILABLE— INTEREST ACCRUES DAILY.I laugh— a cracking glass noise. "Any chance I can pay in existential dread? I’ve got surplus."
"Humor detected. Humor flagged as potential defiance response. Recommending disciplinary oversight." "Put it on the stupid tax."
Adjacent countertops are littered with half‑dissected manikins, rune‑etched organ jars, and crimson binders titled Miracle Efficiency Index—Q4. They logged my transgression as a data set.Here’s the Academy’s math: unauthorized healing equals uncontrolled variables. That terrifies grant committees. Better to let a girl bleed out than risk statistical anomalies in miracle yield.The detox lamps are jealous little suns. They hang from the ceiling like metallic fruit, each one pulsing a sequenced ultraviolet strobe meant to burn residual magic out of flesh. Every third pulse slams into my retinas and ricochets into the back of my skull, leaving after‑images of jagged runes that refuse to blink away. I try to look anywhere else, but the room offers only polished steel, reinforced glass, and the reflection of a handcuffed idiot who tried to save a stranger. The idiot looks tired. His cuffs— thaumically graded adamantite, because of course we can’t skimp on theatrics—are secured to a standing restraint column shaped like a six‑armed tuning fork. The bolt‑ring at my spine buzzes with low‑grade suppression wards, just strong enough to make every lymph node feel like it’s full of crushed ice. My tattoos—entropy wards carved into skin last semester during an ill‑advised practical on harmonic scarring—still glow under the ultraviolet, but the light robs them of color, bleaching violet into something sickly and wrong.A wave of nausea climbs my spine— part detox, part fury. My fingers flex involuntarily, entropy crackling. I force a deep breath— count the sensory anchors:
Cooling coolant smell in distant vents.
Sub‑bass throb of mana turbines.
Sharp tang of copper on tongue.
Clinical white glare prickling eyes.
Heartbeat— heavy, syncopated.
I swallow anger. Not here, not yet.A maintenance automaton trundles by outside the glass partition, spray‑nozzles hissing. It pauses, identifies me as "Biohazard Candidate," and mists the corridor with a lemon‑pine antiseptic that coats the back of my throat in sweet chemical dread. The smell mixes poorly with the copper ghost of my own burned mana still lodged behind my sinuses.I keep checking the chrono‑glyph projected on the far wall. 22:15. 22:16. Each minute drags nails across the chalkboard of my patience. Where is he? The entire Academy knows I melted half a regulator grid re‑knitting a girl’s lungs. Public‑relations crisis, ethics violation, textbook recklessness—pick your scandal flavor. That alone should have Hartnell sprinting down the halls like his starched lab coat’s on fire.Unless, of course, he’s rehearsing the narrative. Drafting the press release where he’s the diligent surgeon blindsided by a rogue student. Polishing the language so "Bodhi Rao" rhymes with "irresponsible martyr."
"Subject displays elevated cortisol, 38 percent above baseline. Recommending sedative rune application."
I raise a brow. "Bill me extra for the lullaby?"
22:19. Footsteps at last. Not the clipped, baton‑steady march of Regulators; these heels are softer, arrogant. The door rune‑scans an approaching badge, decides the newcomer outranks everyone within fifty meters, and swishes open with a hissed salute.The machine lifts an injector sigil; I flinch, readying a counter‑glyph. Before escalation can bloom, another voice ripples down the corridor—smooth, cultured, heavier than the gravity in the room.
"Stand down, Medic&nbsp;#26. The council wants him alive and conscious for questioning."
Footsteps approach— leather soles, unhurried, expensive. I know that cadence: Dr. Lucien Hartnell, Staff Medical Surgeon, absentee guardian of the alley’s dying girl. Scene&nbsp;4’s upcoming antagonist.The moment crystallizes; I can practically feel the narrative baton passing, but Scene 3 isn’t done milking me yet.Regulators snap to stiff attention. The automaton retracts the injector, placing it delicately back on the tray. A red rune flashes on the wall monitor: CODE BLUE: WARD 4B. Someone screams down the hall. A junior medic freezes, panic in his eyes.Dr. Lucien Hartnell glides into view. He doesn't break stride. He doesn't even look at the monitor. He simply raises his left hand, snaps his fingers, and flicks a stabilization glyph—perfectly calculated to the patient’s entropy signature—through the wall. The alarm dies instantly. The screaming stops.He saved a life like he was swatting a fly.Then he turns that gaze on me. Immaculate white coat, high collar starched into an exclamation point, hair silvered at the temples. His surgical mask hangs loose around his neck. Diamond‑point cufflinks wink thaumic gold sigils: Primum non nocere—First, do no harm. The irony prickles.Behind him float two assistant scribes—etheric drones shaped like elongated teardrops of blue light. One of them pulses red as I shift my weight, logging a potential aggression vector. They don't just record; they curate. Every twitch, every elevated heartbeat, every sarcastic aside is being hashed, indexed, and fed into a liability algorithm before I even speak.Hartnell’s eyes rake the room, cataloguing equipment like a head chef spotting fingerprints on silverware. Then he fixes me with a look polished to a mirror sheen. I know that look. Professional disappointment, version 3.6. The one reserved for interns who drop priceless vials and for departmental budgets that arrive one digit short.He pauses, eyes skimming readouts on my file projected in mid‑air. His jaw tightens. I see the moment he clocks the 89 000‑lumen liability tied to my name— a liability linked to his department’s budget because he was off playing god‑knows‑what while a kid flat‑lined.For a second, the projection flickers, overlaid by a memory I can't blink away: a girl's face, grey as ash, blood blooming on pavement like a dark flower. I taste copper. The sarcasm catches in my throat. I didn't save her because of the budget. I saved her because she was scared and I was the only goddamned thing standing between her and the Void.The door’s runic lock disengages with a polite chime.I crack a grin, blood from the split lip finally thawing enough to trickle. "Doctor Hartnell," I croon, voice low, a blade ribboned in velvet. "Glad you could join the fuck‑up you left on hold."
Shock rolls through the ward like silent thunder— the Regulators stiffen, the automaton recalculates threat matrices, the containment lamps flare a defensive yellow. Hartnell’s expression slides from controlled annoyance to ice‑sheen rage.Good. Rage means leverage.But that, as bards say, is another scene’s problem.The containment lamps dim back to sterile white. The automaton withdraws, wheeling its tray of my priced‑out miracle to some accounts‑receivable abyss. The Regulators stand sentinel, wands crackling with non‑lethal voltage.I flex my entropy‑scarred palms behind me, feeling the singe of detox burns and the new‑formed callus of resolve. The system just billed me for compassion. I’m about to invoice it for arrogance.Hartnell steps fully inside, lips parting to speak—
[AUDIO FRAGMENT: FILE_CORRUPT_05 // SOURCE: VIRAL_FEED] Also wrong. Magic isn’t ancestral. Or at least, not entirely. Anyone can learn it, if they survive the process. Yes, some people are born with an edge. Sorcerers with magical, sometimes divine ancestors. Warlocks with spooky contracts. But the rest of us? We’re Wizards. We study. We train. We bleed.
Point being, you don't have to have wizard parents, sell your soul to some Otherworldy Patron, or sleep with a Satyr on a Full-Moon night to cast fancy spells. It might help, sure, but it isn't a prerequisite.
Most folks slot Magi into two neat piles: the "born with it", and "broke themselves for it". Sorcerer's and Wizards. Those born with innate magic and those who learned magic. Depending on how they use their magic, a mage might be a Warlock, Druid, Cleric - or some DIY hybrid nightmare. Labels are blurry. People aren’t spreadsheets.
*Say it with me now: "All Sorcerers, Warlocks, Druids, and Clerics are Wizards. Not all Wizards are Sorcerers, Warlocks Druids, or Clerics. More on this later.*
Magic is a skill. It’s learned, refined, and brutally punishing. Most people burn out before they master their first real spell. And the ones who don’t? They still screw up. One missed calculation and your fireball becomes a localized sun. Good luck explaining that to your neighbors.It can take years of practice, study, and application to be capable of Magic, decades for it to be useful. You ever run into a street magician? I'll bet you a haypenny you've encountered a Mage. That's right, maybe one in ten times, that guy actually pulled that card out of your ear. The sad part is that's probably as much magic as they are capable of. Poor booboo probably exhausted themself for the rest of the day to make you giggle. Magical processes require a lot of concentration. Think the same Order of Magnitude as trying to run PERL code in your head. Physically, you're literally burning calories to give physics that sweet chin music. Combine with the mental toll, and you're looking at a difficulty curve that intersects with NASA Scientists and Olympic Athletes.Absolutely not. The universe is a stingy bastard. Magic increases entropy - chaos. Every spell you cast pushes the universe a little closer to heat death. You can maybe reverse that with some extremely complex negentropic spells, but most mages just blow stuff up and call it a day.In our world, this concept is known as "Equivalent Exchange." You burn what you’ve got to break the rules - heat, stamina, heartbreak, whatever’s handy. Magic doesn’t run on goodwill. If you are prepared, you can use an external source of Magic, and If you get creative enough, that cost can be reduced to next to nothing. But never "something" for "nothing".There’s no "spell slots" or wands that do all the heavy lifting. Every magical action you take costs energy - from your body (Physical Energy), your mind (Spiritual Energy), but usually some mixture of the two. The more intricate or powerful the spell, the more you burn through your reserves.Imagine running a marathon while solving differential equations in your head. That’s what casting a mid-level spell feels like. The higher-tier stuff? That’s Olympic-level burnout paired with a migraine and an existential crisis. Most mages, even those of the highest order, will still find themselves catatonic trying to conjure Silver. Gold? Uranium? Platinum? Don’t even try. Nature charges interest for those. You’d need the First or Fourth Divinity, and those haven’t been seen since gods walked the earth - or pretended to.Because no matter what you do, using magic incurs a cost. And the bill always comes due.
Wanna make a fireball? Best to hang onto that Zippo for now.Hartnell doesn’t step closer. Doesn’t want to catch the contagion of whatever I’ve become—outlaw, martyr, PR nightmare. Instead he addresses the nearest scribe‑drone.
"Begin Session Log," he says, voice as crisp as the crease in his slacks.
A rune blooms mid‑air: Session 2114‑BX — Subject: Rao, B.
"Timestamp twenty‑two twenty." Hartnell’s gaze flicks to me. "Patient is conscious, under custodial restraint, displaying elevated entropy markers and class‑three thaumic contamination."
"Cleric," I correct, tasting blood and peroxide on my tongue. "Cleric contamination."
Hartnell’s smile is thin enough to draft through. "Thank you for your input, Mr. Rao. I’ll annotate the files accordingly once legal counsel advises."
He pivots a fraction— just enough to signal the conversation is a courtesy, not a right. "First and foremost, I trust you appreciate the severity of your misconduct."
"Oh, absolutely," I say. "What’s the etiquette for saving lives these days? Pinky up, two spoons, or just don’t bother?"
His nostrils pinch, but he keeps the veneer. "We have protocols. You violated them— with catastrophic disregard for safety. Five municipal runic grids overloaded in response to your null‑field spike. The regulator beacon registered a thaumic bloom equivalent to a class‑six battle invocation."
"Funny, because I remember it as the equivalent of ‘girl keeps breathing.’ Measurement error, maybe?"
Hartnell ignores the jab and produces a flex tablet. The hologram projects a grainy alley feed: me kneeling, runes flaring violet, regulations be damned. Audio picks up my hoarse voice crooning that nugget of the Old Speech, Burn the end into birth. A moment later, the spike—surveillance sigils spiral into static. Hartnell freezes the frame on the girl’s reanimated gasp. "Heroic cinematography," he says, "but let’s examine consequences. Your unsupervised null‑field ruptured three municipal time‑delay wards. If a displacement inversion propagated—"
"—the block could have hosted a flash blizzard. But it didn’t. Because I anchored the field. Because someone," I jangle the cuffs, "wasn’t there to do his job."
The temperature drops a metaphorical ten degrees.
"I was summoned to an emergency quorum on resource allocation," Hartnell says, tone clipped. "We’re finalizing upgrades to the academic trauma wing, the very wing that allows you students your subsidized graveside tinkering."
"Tinkering? She was dying, Hartnell. This wasn't some foray into Medical Experimentation that I undertook out of curiosity!"
"And now the Academy’s facing an investigatory board­—Ethics, Regulation, Mana Infrastructure." Hartnell’s voice remains measured, but the veneer strains. "Do you understand what that means, Mr. Rao? Every grant, every licensure, every bed in our wards is hostage to perception. Your theatrics jeopardized more lives than you imagine."
"Perception?" The word tumbles out half‑laugh, half‑growl. "Is that what flips the healing switch? Not the Hippocratic Oath, not common decency— just whether the paperwork sparkles?" The room goes dark, save for the emergency lights. Hartnell turns to leave.
"A pity," he says softly. "You have such... capacity. But capacity without control is just a bomb waiting for a fuse."
He pauses at the threshold.
"We will garnish your assets to balance the ward expenditure, Mr.&nbsp;Rao. Your father's care account, the clinic lease, your omni-tool license. All of it."
My sarcasm respirator fails. The air leaves my lungs not in a quip, but a hollow rattle. For a second, I'm not a defiant cleric; I'm a son watching a ventilator screen go dark.
"Consider this mercy. We are removing the matches from your hands."
I grind my teeth through the pulse. "Systems that abandon a bleeding kid because the surgeon of record’s sipping canapés at a donors’ gala."
His eyes harden. "Watch your tone."
"Or what? You’ll what, dock my nonexistent pay? Flunk me out of a program that already affixed the target on my back?"
The door hisses open again. A pair of Regulators step in, hands resting on truncheons etched with subdual glyphs. Hartnell doesn’t acknowledge them; they’re punctuation.
He exhales. "Let me clarify the predicament. A student cleric, unauthorized, performed forbidden spellwork resulting in infrastructure damage and violation of the Mana Stability Accords. Fact. Said student’s academic record—" swipe, swipe, hologram flips to my transcripts— "notes disciplinary warnings for insubordinate commentary during Grand Rounds, breaches of curfew, possession of restricted grimoires. Pattern of defiance. Fact."
One Regulator smirks. I memorize his badge number.
"Investigators will extrapolate," Hartnell continues. "They will ask if your instructors foster radicalism. They will ask whether the Academy endorses vigilantism. The donors whose generosity keeps our wards active will ask if their names are tarnished. Do you grasp the scale?"
I stare at him, fighting the suppression field’s vertigo. My heart hammers arrhythmic, a stubborn drum corps refusing to cede tempo.
"I grasp that a girl breathes tonight. That scale fits in my palms fine."
Hartnell’s voice drops. "And if she had imploded? If that null‑field collapsed the block and turned half a district into entropy slurry?"
"Then I’d take responsibility. The difference between us? I was there to try."
The regulator behind me tugs a baton loose, perhaps anticipating we’ll skip straight to the beating portion. Hartnell lifts a hand— hold. He steps closer, finally breaching the invisible moat. I catch hints of bergamot cologne layered over something else. Not guilt. Formaldehyde and old paper.
He lowers his voice. "I recognize talent, Rao. Your early practicals were… spectacular." He says it like a diagnosis. "But raw talent without governance is a loaded wand at a toddler’s birthday. If you truly wish to heal, submit to the system. Accept censure, remedial courses, recalibration of your entropy thresholds—"
"—and let that girl die?"
"The ambulance would have reached her eventual—"
"She had three minutes."
Hartnell doesn't flinch. He doesn't look away. He looks... tired. The weariness of a man who has had this conversation a thousand times, usually with a mirror.
"Three minutes," he repeats, weighing the words. "And in exchange for those three minutes, you risked a Class IV audit. Your mother had that same disregard for variables, Bodhi."
The name hits me like a riot baton to the gut. Nalini.
"She was brilliant," Hartnell continues, voice thickening with something dangerously close to reverence. "But she never understood that a surgeon needs a shield, not just a scalpel. I didn't build this department to restrain you, Bodhi. I built it so you wouldn't have to die to make a difference. Like she did."
My vision blurs. The containment field whines as my entropy spikes.
"You don't get to throw her name in my face," I snarl. "I am not your failure, 'Lucy boy'."
Hartnell stiffens. The nickname—the one she used to tease him with in the residency lounge during double shifts—strikes him like a physical blow. For a split second, the polished mask cracks. I see outrage there, hot and messy, shadowed by a quiet, devastating guilt.
"You and the rest of her 'friends' let her burn herself out," I accuse, voice shaking. "You let her die to cover for your own mediocrities!" "I was her student, Rao!" he snaps, the volume finally cracking the clinical hush. "I respected her more than anyone. But I watched her burn herself out on lost causes until there was nothing left for the patients who could be saved." He steps closer, eyes pleading for the first time. "You were supposed to be the one who survived! The one who balanced the equation! Instead, you're just... her. Another beautiful, burning waste."
The math is cold. It's also correct. That makes it worse. But I look at his cufflinks—diamond-point, catching the sterile light.
"Tell me," I say, voice softer now, dangerous. " did you convince yourself of that before or after the third glass of vintage wine at the gala tonight? While you were courting cheques?"
I lean in, fighting the restraint field.
"You talk about survival, Doctor. But you look remarkably comfortable in your cage. Do you even taste the food anymore? Or does it all just taste like the compromises you swallowed to pay for it?"
Hartnell’s expression doesn't crack again. It solidifies. He looks at me not with anger, but with a terrifying, dull sympathy.
Hartnell straightens, smoothing a crease in his coat that didn't exist. "I burned like you once, Rao. You think you're the first to discover righteous indignation? It doesn't end in glory. It ends in ash or ice." "At least ash is real," I spit. He signals the Regulators. The moment is over. "I chose ice," he murmurs, almost to himself. "Because ice preserves things."
One Regulator strides forward, producing a new pair of cuffs inscribed with more aggressive suppression runes.
"On your knees," he barks.
I don’t move. I hold Hartnell’s gaze.
"You chose wrong, Doctor," I say.
My eyes find his, searching for the man who must have existed before the budget meetings.
"Let it burn."
Hartnell pauses. For a second, just a second, the ice thaws enough to show the cracks underneath. Then he turns away.
"Doctor."
He pauses at the threshold.
Hartnell answers without turning. "If your hands endanger this Academy again, Mr. Rao, there won’t be enough of them left to catch a raindrop."
The door seals, swallowing him in lamplight.The Regulators are rough but rote. Baton man yanks me free of the restraint column, clamps the new cuffs tight enough to numb. Mana‑dampening glyphs crawl over my skin like frost spiders, but I keep Hartnell’s departing silhouette etched behind my eyelids, a negative image that fuels the furnace.They march me down a narrow service corridor smelling of coolant and despair, past frosted windows where other students pretend not to look. Each step rattles the floor grate. I catalog the route—I lift my hand again. The rune is gone. Faded to a faint, violet bruise that feels like sunburn under the skin.
"Next stop," I whisper to the silent, white room that smells of ozone and old fear. "The Tribunal." Left at the oxidized vent stack, right past the silent morgue elevator—because the practical part of my mind is already mapping escapes.
We stop at a thick quartz door stenciled Holding A‑3: High Entropy Risk. The lock‑glyph utters its sterile chirp, slides open. Inside, a cube of blank white angles waits. No runic graffiti yet— challenge accepted.The guard shoves me just hard enough that I stumble. A swallow of laughter bubbles up; I let it out.
"Careful. I’m fragile inventory."
The door seals. Suppression wards thrummm in their endless hum. In solitude, the detox burns fade to an ache. My thoughts, unmuted, roar.I think of the girl— unknown name, lungs full of winter air instead of blood. I think of Hartnell’s cufflinks gleaming First, do no harm while he weaponized procedure to justify inaction. I press my forehead to the cool quartz and exhale the promise I forged in violet fire.
"If the system won’t heal," I whisper, "then the system’s the illness."
Somewhere distant, a chime announces tribunal preparations. I flex my hands, even though the cuffs bite. The hunger to fix things gnaws louder than the pain.
[AUDIO FRAGMENT: FILE_CORRUPT_06 // SOURCE: VIRAL_FEED] Feckin' laughable. Capital L. Magic isn’t uniform. It’s messy. It's inconsistent. It’s personal. But try telling that to an academy-trained bureaucrat with a wand up their ass and a PhD in Thaumaturgy. The magical world loves its categories - Magecraft vs. Occult Practice, "High Magic" vs. "Wild Magic," formal vs. tribal. As if a hex from a back-alley Bokor is somehow less legitimate than a spell written in eleven-point Times New Roman with footnotes. They divvied up magic into "Schools" like a Hogwarts-themed TED Talk: Alchemy? Chemistry with a god complex. Potions? Middle-school chemistry, but deadly. Runic Magic? Writing that bites. Ritual Magic? Weird hats, Latin chanting, and definitely candles. Divination? Magical gambling with worse odds than Vegas. And Healing? Oh, that’s where they put us - the glorified magical nurses. You know, the ones who hold you together while everyone else is too busy blowing things up for prestige.
If you really want to get spicy, ask ten different nations what "real" magic looks like. In Vaticanus, it’s prayer. In NAMF, it’s code. In Moscow-Kiev, it’s socialist ritualism. Then you’ve got the stuff the Western world either exoticizes or ignores - Djinn-binding in Cairo, shadowcasting in Lagos, Kabbalistic syntax in Jerusalem, Tantric recursion in the Punjab Republic. These aren’t just styles. They’re entire magical ideologies, shaped by belief, geography, and power. Magic isn’t neutral - it reflects who gets to define "order" and whose gods are allowed to speak. Westerners love acting like they discovered structure, but go tell a Haitian Bokor or a Himalayan monk that their magic’s outdated. If they’re feeling generous, you’ll walk away with a minor hex. If not? Well… hope your insurance covers metaphysical trauma. *Alchemy – "Chemistry with a god complex."
*Potions – "Middle-school chemistry, but deadly."
*Runic Magic – "Writing that bites."
*Ritual Magic – "Weird hats, chanting in dead languages, probably some candles."
*Spellcasting – "The 'Just Add Fireball' school."
*Healing Magic – "Where miracles and malpractice meet."
*Divination – "Basically magical gambling."
*Dark Magic – "Exactly what it sounds like."
*Chaos, Entanglement, Mind, Environmental Magic – "A catch-all for weirdos who couldn’t pick a lane."
*Thaumaturgy – "The science of magical bullshit." The door seals behind me with the hiss of a scab re‑forming. No clang, no theatrical boom—just a polite exhalation of pressured air as layers of rune‑latticed crystal slide into place. A pulse slithers through the cell’s perimeter glyphs, colorless lightning mapping the walls before dwindling to a faint infrared shimmer. They’ve warded this box to within an inch of theological paranoia: null‑weave mesh in the grout, dampening runes at knee height, a suppression lattice that hums just below the threshold of conscious hearing.I conduct the room‑check on reflex—the same checklist they drill into every Academy initiate—but the irony is a razor to the gums. Containment integrity? Immaculate. Escape vectors? None worth the entropy burn. Magical field density? Negative—beyond baseline, really; my own aura feels like it’s wearing a straightjacket three sizes too small.I flex my fingers. Knuckles pop. The echo dies a timid death against the glassy pane that passes for a window: three centimeters of ward‑infused silicate, fogged to opacity from the other side. I see my reflection instead.Shit. I look wrecked. Split lip, one nostril caked in dried crimson, detox scorch marks striped across my forearms like phantom cuffs. The violet flare I spotted earlier—inkless veins of light licking across my entropy wards—have faded to inert graphite, but a faint shimmer lingers when I breathe too sharply. I file that under: concerning, revisit later.The cell is eight paces long, five paces wide— because that’s how many paces it takes before my heel clips the far bench. I pivot, pace again. Eight, five, turn. There’s a timetable hidden in the rhythm: father’s respirator beeping in memory’s ICU; mother’s heartbeat monitor stuttering to a final flatline; Academy tuition invoices piling like bad omens on our kitchen table back in the days when rent was a near‑mythic creature—always migrating, never home.Eight, five, turn.My breath fogs white ghosts into the chill. Condensation webs across the ward‑glass, fat droplets dragging slow tears downward—a mockery of the girl’s alveoli earlier, knitting themselves back together under my palms. A fresh jolt of anger flares at Hartnell’s lacquered indignation, at the Regulators’ lock‑step morality, at the elder board’s impending pageantry. My anger tastes of solder smoke and old pennies.
"You can’t keep me caged forever," I mutter—to the walls, the wards, the memory of Dr. Lucien Hartnell’s immaculate sneer. "But you’ll try, won’t you? Gods forbid a kid keeps breathing without a signed requisition form."
The room’s lights do not answer. They only flicker—once, like nervous laughter trapped in a filament.
My perception shifts.It starts as the high‑frequency buzz of the suppression lattice but morphs—subtly, inexorably—into the whine of ventilators. I’m no longer pacing a holding cell; I’m back in St. Gabrielle’s Medical Wing, three years prior, fluorescent bulbs bleaching everything to corpse&nbsp;colors.Dad lies swaddled in thrumming machinery. An arcane respirator—part machine, part bound elementals—forces each rise and fall of his chest. Respiratory Failure Type&nbsp;IV. A cleric from the Academy briefed us on prognosis in the dulcet tones reserved for terminal cases: "Stable as long as the mana subsidy lasts." Translation: Stable until you can’t pay.Mom signed the release forms with shaking hands. Their ink smudged; her knuckles did the same. We spent nights counting medical crystals, recalculating how many cubic centimeters of regulated miracle we could afford.I remember kissing Dad’s forehead, tasting antiseptic and fear. I remember whispering a promise: I’ll learn, Dad. I’ll fix this.The memory fractures——reassembling into a bursar’s office lined with floating ledger‑orbs. Numbers scroll along their mirrored surfaces, each digit another centimeter of noose. Scholarships? Conditional. Loans? Predatory. My acceptance letter glowed like salvation until the addendum spelled out the price of each "authorized" miracle: Fifty‑two thousand credits per annum, reagent cost not included.Mom sold the house. The respirator bill swelled anyway. I deferred a semester, took two jobs—graveyard shifts at a mana refinery and midnight runs in a trauma clinic triage bay where license checks were more optional suggestion than rule. That’s where I learned to hack the Academy limiters—small tweaks at first, life or death tweaks eventually.Back in present, my pacing falters. A metallic tang pricks behind my teeth—anger, adrenaline, or just poor ventilation. Hard to tell.Condensation on the glass sharpens into an ICU window again, but this one belongs to Mom. Pneumonic Magic Burn—complication from a spell she cast to save a child trapped in a flood. Unauthorized thaumaturgy, no protective null field. She drowned from the inside while regulators filed negligence charges.I visited during the "family hours" they grant right before final collapse. Mom pressed a shaking finger to my chest. "Power is only sacred when it’s spent lifting another soul. So reach—any hour, any street—and take their weight, even if the world never thanks you. Let purpose pay the cost gratitude can’t. And when your own flame gutters, make sure the room is crowded with hearts you’ve carried. Don’t slip away lonely like your father and me." The monitor silenced before I could answer. The curtain between us and everything righteous fell.Back to the claustrophobic present.I stop pacing. I will not be her martyr. I’ve bled tuition, sweat, tears, and enough raw entropy to power a small city, but I will not be a footnote mislabeled reckless.I wipe away the hanging beads of condensation, clearing a narrow patch on the ward‑glass. My breath fogs it again, a fresh canvas. With the tip of my index, I draw—slow, deliberate lines: a downward hook, two crossing slashes, a spiral folding in on itself. It’s the entropy sigil they teach as cautionary lore in Intro to Magical Thermodynamics—the symbol you should never evoke without stabilizers, because it invites chaos to dinner and forgets to set the table.My finger glows faintly as I trace. The ward‑glass sizzles where skin meets silicate, but no alarms scream. The suppression lattice shivers, unsure whether to stop me—this gesture is too small, too symbolic to quantify as a violation.The spiral completes. A tremor ripples through my bones—like a tuning fork struck in the marrow. The sigil hums a note I feel more than hear, resonant with the latent violet flicker buried under my skin. It’s not magic, not exactly. It’s intention. Intent shapes resonance; resonance becomes potential.
"There’s a cost for every miracle," I whisper, voice rasping the cell’s recycled air. "So charge me. I’m done bartering with innocent lives."
I press my palm flat against the sigil. The cold eats through the calluses. Memory and present overlap until I’m holding my father’s hand, clutching my mother’s, stabilizing a dying stranger, all at once.A single tear escapes—annoyingly sentimental—but I don’t wipe it. It crawls to my jaw, drops, splashes on the rune‑scored floor. It hisses where it lands. The lattice dims fractionally; the system registers an anomaly but not enough to mobilize.I breathe, count to five, release.My life until tonight has been scaffolding—courses, clinical rotations, sanctioned mission trips to disaster zones where every act of compassion came with a compliance checklist. That scaffolding is ash now. What I did in the alley was the bare minimum of what a cleric should do, yet it shattered the facade. The board will brand me reckless. Hartnell will spin a narrative where his absence is procedural necessity and my intervention is criminal zealotry.Fine.I step back from the sigil. It glows faintly on the glass, pulsing with each heartbeat—mine, the girl’s, Mom’s, Dad’s—a little constellation of debts.In the distant corridor, a klaxon bleats: two throaty wails and a long drone. That’s the signal for transfer— they’re moving detainees to pre‑trial holding. My time in this box is up.I straighten. Shake the stiffness from my shoulders. The sigil fades—the condensation bead‑trails evaporating as if ashamed. But the imprint stays branded behind my eyelids.Eight paces to the door. I’m halfway across when the rune locks unseal with a percussive clack. The door slides, revealing two Regulators in muted crimson, their batons crackling with polite menace.
"Rao, Bodhi. Transfer protocol," the taller one states, visor reflecting my ghost‑lit face.
I nod, wrists offered. The cuffs are colder than before, or maybe I’ve just run out of body heat to lose.As they guide me into the corridor, I glance back. The humid patch on the window is gone. Only a faint outline—less visible than a fingerprint—remains where the entropy spiral once burned.But I know it’s there. Like a promise sworn in blood and cold flame.The Regulators march me toward an elevator caged in thaumic mesh. Beyond the grate, the shaft descends deeper—toward tribunal chambers, public scrutiny, and the choreography of institutional judgment. I roll my shoulders, composing arguments sharper than scalpels and jokes darker than the shaft’s abyss.Next stop: the Tribunal of Ivory Smiles.
Let them bare their teeth. I’ve already tasted worse.]]></description><link>manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-02-draft.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Projects/Writing/Books/The Cleric Saga/_bmad-output/manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-02-draft.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:17:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[chapter-01-draft]]></title><description><![CDATA[Cracked linoleum slits my knees like spite. The kind of petty cut you don't notice until it's stinging through your trousers and the adrenaline backs off. My breath fogs against the kind of winter air that doesn't just invade but squats in corners like it's paying rent. This cheap community "alley"-clinic stinks of half-sterilized bandages, mana-rot, burnt hair, and the quiet panic that lingers when death overstays its welcome. Faintly, the sound of royalty-free "muzak" haunts its way through the air, the Infomercial on the waiting room TV turned up. The girl beneath me convulses again.
"Shh… shh, hey. You’re okay. You’re not—"
Her spine jerks, back arching like a snapped bowstring, mouth frothing in crescents of pink. Her ribs rattle like a bag of old dice under my hands. Blood where there shouldn't be blood, breath where there shouldn't be gaps. Every twitch is a clock tick closer to an obituary. She's losing air, time, and odds—all at once. And me? I'm gambling with Magic.She’s maybe fifteen. Just a kid. Poor thing couldn't even get herself through the door. Pulse in freefall. Every rune-monitor in this slapdash trauma bay screams in a different dialect. A salvaged electrocardiogram kit whines next to a busted cauldron half-full of thaumic coolant. Someone has duct-taped a sanctified camphor talisman to the ceiling. Another has scrawled "LOVE IS A MIRACLE" over it in marker. Yeah? Try billing that to the regulator council.I don't have time to guess how long she's been dying, or how poorly I set this place up, or why the universe keeps leaving corpses at my feet and asking for a receipt. She's here. I'm here. No one else is.I press my palms to her sternum. Cold skin. Too light. The bones feel like they belong to someone who never finished growing.
"ThRun-kel Tuu Vaar'lenna"
No Echo. No Decay.
A pulse kicks from deep in my diaphragm as a Null Field snaps into existence. The air distorts, rippling outward like the heat shimmer on asphalt, then stills. Reality—mundane, lawful, sanitized physics—gets politely evicted. The field blooms. Spherical. Fragile. A dome of anti-reality laced with stolen spells and prayers I barely believe in. The "Old Speech" tends to have that kind of environmental impact, but I'm going for broke here. The standard Med Protocol Statis Field would not be able to handle the severity of her wounds, or the consequences if what I'm about to do is detected.The tattoos etched across my forearms—entropy wards carved in ink and nerve endings—ignite. Pale violet. Huh. That's new. Questions for later.
"Shul'dara Vek Thae-lun"
Burn the end into Birth
I start the incantation. The real one. No Academy-template safezone spells. No healing-lite first-aid authorized by thaumaturgical ethics boards. This is real magic, raw and unlicensed, hates being bent into shape.Each word tears its way up my throat like barbed wire. The null field hums louder, resisting the feed. Magic floods my limbs, burning as it threads itself through my arms. Through scar tissue from doing this sort of thing once-too-often, and spent muscle from just having a day-and-a-half. I force it down, into my wrists, into my fingers.Her wound slowly start shuddering as they stitch themselves together, previously-spilled ichor tracing its way back inside it's host.Not fast enough. Not nearly fast enoughShe's drowning inside herself. Organ failure. Lungs filling. My field tenses. Feedback spirals along my spine. The limiter—every damn student has one, coded into our IDs, our aura signatures, even the cuffs of our coats—snaps back like a whip.I push harder, audibly snarling. Focus. I redirect flow from my shoulders into the small fractures in my hands. The scars glow brighter –faint, ethereal cracks leaking sickly magenta light. My nails crack from the pressure.
"Come on," I mutter. "Come on, breathe."
Another pulse. Runes etched into the null field flare too wide, too sharp. If anyone nearby has a regulator beacon tuned, they’ll feel that. Screw it. I keep going.
"Vaelun"
"Please." Not a spell. A plea.Her alveoli begin to reknit. Capillaries reroute. Blood reverses direction like I'm unwinding her death.Then—a single inhale. Wet, but real.She jerks. Once. Then goes limp.Still.Still.And then—A breath.Holy shit.She's alive.For a single heartbeat, the world holds.And then the null field screams.Every rune-lamp in the alley explodes in sequence. Light. Shatter. Feedback. The regulator beacon embedded in the mana flow pings out like a flare. I’d bet half my tuition credits someone three blocks away just felt that. The spell collapses inward, folding the null field like paper into itself. Entropy backlash punches through my arms, singeing nerve endings raw. The air smells of ozone, blood, and divine sarcasm.Sirens bloom on the horizon. Not the friendly kind.I’m running out of time.
"Nihil sanctus. Resurgo."
The final phrase stings my gums as I seal the spell. I play it safe, ending the Triplet with Latin for stability, even if leaning on mass-production spellwork tastes a bit wrong in my mouth. Internal lattice reweaves. Circulatory rhythm stabilizes. Her color improves.I wrap her in a silver-foil thermal, tucking the edges under her elbows. I reach into my coat, unhook the entropy-seal clasped to my wrist—my tracker, my confession, my crime—and place it beside her fingers.Footsteps thud. Not fast. Intentional. Crimson-armored Regulators appear at the alley mouth in a staggered diamond formation. Wands already drawn. Suppression wards vibrating across their forearms.Eight of them. Full complement. They were expecting worse.
"Hands where we can see them!"
I stay kneeling.I raise my hands.Magic still dances in my bones. My grip on it loosens as I let it go.
"I was just practicing my thesis," I say.
Helmet visors don’t crack smiles. Worth a shot.
"Step away from the girl."
"She’s stable. If you touch her before the field fully fades, she’ll spike and you’ll have killed her."
They don’t care. Two step forward.
"Uh-uh, fellas. Florence Nightingale's got that sweet chin music for you if you touch my patient". Knowing their attention needs to be kept on me, I lean back on my heels and sit myself on my rear, my legs splayed and oh-so-conveniently blocking their path to the teen. The two give a glance at one another, before rejoining the group to form a half-circle. One begins the arrest ritual, voice flat, like I’m just another datapoint.
"Name. Student ID. Magical license class."
I tilt my head. Real slow. Let the silence drag an extra beat. Then I twist my lips into the most exaggerated, cartoonishly unimpressed pout I can muster—upper lip out, nose crinkled, eyelids half-mast like I’ve just smelled bureaucratic rot baking in the sun.
"No." I really let that syllable drag out. Not shouted. Not whispered. Just... stated. Like gravity. Or spite. I swear even their hoods looked shocked.
"You refuse to comply?"
"I'm declining to comply, Chief" I say, the vowels dripping with the sacred indignation of a Looney Tune on his last carrot.
"Subtle difference."
Somewhere in the back of my head, I hear a faint wahh-wahhhh fade in the distance. One of the Hoods with a Golden North Atlantic Magic Federation Insignia emblazoned on his right-arm gauntlet steps forward. I wonder if he can see my smirk behind that visor.A wand muzzle touches my temple. It hums.
Yeah. He saw it.
"Unauthorized miracle-working in a restricted zone."
"Emergency clause."
"No academy supervisor signed off."
That’s it. That’s the moment.I throw my arms up in full-body disbelief, like I’m trying to scoop the sheer stupidity out of the air with my hands.
"She was dying! That's what makes it an emergency, you phenomenal DUNCE!"
My hands are flying. I’m gesturing like a man explaining fire to cavemen. One hand clutches at my own hair while the other points furiously at the void where this specimen’s common sense should be. I'm stunned—stunned—that this conversation is real.Then—
"And you are not cleared to make that call!"
He says it like it’s checkmate.I let out a laugh that’s more exhale than joy. Stare at him like I just caught a goose trying to recite algebra.
"Oh, give your balls a tug!"
I sneer, but internally I feel a bit of my fight deflate, my hands dropping to their side with it. Of course not. I'm not a licensed miracle-worker. Just a student. Just a cleric-in-training with a chip on his shoulder and a naive deathgrip on his remaining conscience.They slap the cuffs on. Cold metal laced with dampening sigils bites into the skin above my entropy scars. Numbness radiates. A sob tries to rise in my throat, but I’ve already learned how to kill those before they show.How do lawyers not break down in "Frustration TearsTM" when they're arguing in court?? Goddamn Sociopaths.I look down one last time. She’s breathing. God's above, she's actually still breathing. Sounds like a wet maraca, but it's there, and steady. Good. At least, way better than it was ten minutes ago.I exhale. The cuffs hiss.
"Fuck magic."
The shackles click shut.Let's talk about magic."The supernatural and mysterious power of apparently influencing a course of events." The ultimate cop-out for writers the world over. "Spooky action at a distance" if you're Einstein-inclined. Greeeeeeat. Those are the definitions you’d get if you asked a bored teenager who just binge-watched the entire Harry Potter franchise in one sitting. Magic, as mundanes tend to understand it, is basically a shortcut to doing stuff that would normally require effort, intelligence, or batteries. Which is hilarious, considering how much work it actually takes.I refuse to bother with a "real definition" for concept so nebulous. It's a wonder anyone can even pretend to define it. You already know what Magic is. Or at least, you think you do. Fireballs. Lightning. Glowy runes. Whatever.
If it's shiny and not a mushroom, it's probably magic. How's that for a rigorous academic approach?But what's really going on behind the curtain of sparkles and special effects? What is Magic?I'll tell you.
Magic is Some Ol' Bullshit.By and large, I'd say Harry Potter is to blame for people's preconceptions. Harry asks Hagrid why the magical world is secret and gets some spiel about how "aaaall the muggles" would want to start using magic to solve all of their problems.When the HELL has anything worked that way?Everything has a cost. Especially magic. And that cost is rarely financial. Though in modern society, magic tends to follow the same principle everything else does: "If you're good at it, never do it for free." If you want to get something, you have to give something up. And with Magic, you never quite get or give what you expected to.You know, while I'm on the topic, let's address the whole "muggle" and "mudblood" thing. NO ONE is investing time, effort, and energy on special slurs to call people based on magical lineage.
Well…some people might but there are weirdos like that everywhere, we don't consider outliers. Trust me, we already have more than enough slurs… Case in point! My family is from India; I was raised as a citizen of the illustrious North Atlantic Magical Federation (a.k.a Woodbridge, New Jersey).The Federation has had access to the internet and cell phones as long as it's Mundane Counterpart; someone called me the "n-word" in traffic on Thursday. The Magical and Mundane peoples are just as advanced (and just as backwards) as one another. Humans are the same no matter where you go.We call that "progress".The wagon stinks of ozone, piss, and bureaucratic boredom. Chain-runes hiss every time I shift, crackling in some ancient dialect designed to shame sorcerers before laws even existed. They line the bars like barbed wire made of light, looping lazy helixes across the metal mesh of the cage. Cold bleeds through the floor, right into my spine. Every time the wagon hits a bump, the chain-loop under my seat flares a glyph in warning—reminding me that one twitch too far will sear through the skin.I sit cuffed, knees jammed against the slatted walls, ankles throbbing from where a dampening glyph kissed bone. The whole transport feels like an apology for compassion: cramped, loud, and rolling at a crawl down back alleys too narrow for emergency service but somehow wide enough to haul away unlicensed medics. The roof leaks condensation from spell-dampened air, and every drop that lands on me feels like the system spitting.Two Regulators sit opposite me, crimson armor gleaming like sin in the pulse-light. Helmets full-face, visors opaque. They haven’t spoken since they shoved me in the cage. Probably trained not to. If they said anything, it might sound like doubt.
"You know,"
I say, loud enough to make their posture twitch,
"in some countries, healing without a license is called 'heroism.'"
No reply. Fine. I wasn’t really talking to them anyway.
"Bet the girl makes it," I add, tone too casual to be anything but pointed.
"Wouldn’t that be awkward? Alive and breathing and…not regulated, none of it."
The one on the left tilts their helmet a hair. A shift smaller than a nod, but I clock it. Progress. Or maybe checking their rune-feed for violations of the local noise ordnance.
"Just think,"
I continue, leaning back until the chain-runes tug sharp at my wrists,
"if I'd let her die, none of this paperwork would be necessary.
No reports.
No tribunal.
No sleepless nights wondering about all the regulations I broke
and if they're thinking about you too."
Still nothing. No verbal response, no twitch, no weight shift. But I catch the subtle tightening of a gauntlet, the telltale flutter of overclocked heart rate in the ambient hum of the suppression ward. The one on the right's pulse just spiked. Bingo.
"All those Combat Magic courses
they have you guys running must be
winding you up too tight,"
I say, furrowing my brow in a performance of concern.
"Must be hard, carrying all that armor and none of the moral weight. Heeeavy stuff, boys, heavy stuff."
That gets a reaction. Barely. The right one's shoulders twitch like he wants to shrug off the insult and can't decide if that counts as breaking formation.
"They must teach you all sorts of high-octane badassery, right? What is it these days? Arcane CQC? Wand-kata? Tactical Pilates? Wait wait, no I got it! Hot yoga!"
I lean forward with a grin I know will get under his skin.
"C'mon, big guy, what’s the secret sauce?
Do you guys chant in unison,
paint slogans on your chests before beating up street kids?
Or is it more of a spontaneous thing?"
The tension in the hothead's jaw is now a tectonic event. He hasn't moved, but the restraint in his posture is screaming. The kind of scream that comes right before a punch.
"Okay,"
I say, like I'm offering a lifeline.
"First answer that comes to mind:
One hundred of your elite unit versus one silverback gorilla—who wins?"
SLAM.The sound is a thunderclap. The impact knocks the air out of me before I process the pain. My head cracks against the steel mesh wall with a dull thud. Stars burst behind my eyes. Tinnitus screams in both ears. Copper floods my mouth.Hothead's up, gauntlet braced across my throat, the bulk of his armor pressing me into the van's reinforced wall like he's trying to meld me with it.
"KEEP. YOUR MOUTH. SHUT"
Each word is a hammer. Or maybe that was his fist. Each pause, a countdown. The kind of tone that tells you this isn't about me—not really. This is about something already cracked inside him and me showing him the fracture line.My chains rattle as I raise my hands a few inches, chuckling painfully—not in surrender, just enough to show I'm not going to fight him. Not yet.I lean my head back as far as the wall allows, staring up at the sigil-riddled ceiling.
"Not trying to provoke you,"
I croak, voice hoarse with pressure and pride. "Well… not only. I'm just trying to fill the silence."
Before it fills me first, the last part I leave unsaid.He holds there for a beat. Two. Breathing hard. The regulator's gauntlet trembles for half a second before he pushes off, steps back, and resumes his silent post like nothing happened. Like I imagined it. Like he's not one weak insult away from kicking my ribs in.I cough, blood in my teeth now, and smile like I’m proud of it. Because I am.Next checkpoint's close. I can feel it in the way the hum of the runes syncs with my heartbeat.Good. I’m starting to run out of things to say.The city outside blurs by. I try not to track it too closely. New Canaan's alleys all look the same when you're on your way to get publicly flogged by bureaucracy. But the moment we round a corner and the ward-glass clears, I get a clean look at the skyline. It hits like always: a punch to the throat made of glass and privilege.Above the slums: the sky-bridges. Floating over half-frozen gutters and blown-out wards, they gleam like myth. Suspended by ley-tethers and taxpayer arrogance, the Academy towers connect overhead like the bones of some divine spinal cord. Clinics up there don’t use salvaged glyph-lamps or bootleg entropy seals. They have name-brand miracles. Branded. Billable. One floor for necrotics. Two for the elite-class trauma ward. Three for the insurance-backed rebirth suites.A perfect place to get sick, if you can afford it.Below, the street-level looks like a field hospital designed by a committee of vultures. Blood-slick slush slops under our wheels. Half the rune tags on the buildings are faded, overwritten with gang sigils or protest glyphs. I spot one that says "HEAL US OR HAUNT US" in spray-rune. Can't tell if it's a threat or a prayer. Someone tagged a ward-drain with a stencil of the Angel of Entropy, wings half-melted.
"Tell me,"
I ask the Regulators,
"when you signed up to protect the magical public interest,
was criminalizing CPR part of the recruitment poster?"
Stone silence. They’ve either muted their helm-audio or filed me under ‘rhetorical hazard.’I shift again. Chain-runes bite my wrist like they resent my pulse. Probably do. These things were forged to bind deviance, not dialogue. Every move I make pings a silent report to the Academy’s Enforcement Matrix. I imagine some overworked functionary back at HQ scrolling through my vitals like a bored ex.
"Ever wonder what a miracle's worth?"
I murmur.
"Not in credits. In consequence."
Still nothing. Maybe they don't have clearance to talk about metaphysics. Maybe they just don't get paid enough.We roll to a stop.The gate checkpoint. Reinforced sigil-barrier, three layers deep, staffed by more crimson meat-suits holding arc-pikes like they were born gripping them. The wagon lurches as it docks into the intake platform. A dozen anti-teleport wards spark briefly as the runes verify we’re not smuggling eldritch contraband or curse-slugs. I sit very still, mostly to savor the irony. Once, this same checkpoint let me through with a lunchbox full of Class II healing runes and no questions asked.The lead tech – some poor bastard who looks about fifteen under their helm – waves a wand through the window slit. "Subject: Rao, Bodhi. Suspected Class IV unauthorized miracle-working. Confirmed thaumic residuals.En route to Academy Custody."
One of the watchers glances at the readout. Her jaw tenses.
"Cleric track?"
"Fourth-Year,"
the other replies.
"Shit."
The sound is barely audible, but I catch it. She covers with protocol.
"Proceed." The wagon rolls on.Through the next viewport I see a boy – maybe twelve – watching from behind a chain-fence, bundled in a coat five sizes too big. Her Brother I realize in recognition. I barely clocked the kid before, too preoccupied with saving the girl 's- his sister I remind myself -life. There is the faint recollection of him screaming bloody murder as I shunted him inside the clinic and set up my makeshift Trauma Bay in the alley. When our eyes meet, he makes the sign of healing. Not the Academy one. The old one. Fingers curled, thumb to sternum. Passed down by grandmothers who never made it past orientation exams. The kind of sign you learn when your miracles are all secondhand.I give him a wink and a quick smile; the boy was worried to bits about his older sister, no need to stress him out any further.The cage jolts as we pass under another suppression arch. Somewhere behind me, an etheric scanner starts logging my aura decay. It’ll show entropy scars flaring on contact with the girl. It won’t log the hesitation in my hands. The silent prayer. The look in her brother's face when she finally stopped seizing. The breath that wasn’t supposed to come back.None of that goes in the file.
"You know what your problem is?"
I say to the rune-bars.
They don’t answer.
"You're efficient.
You're clean.
You're quiet.
You erase stories as well as scars."
Still nothing.But the runes glow a little dimmer. Or maybe that's just me.Next stop: Containment Ward 7-C. Cold fire, automated scanners, and a medic who thinks I’m a contaminated tool.Can’t wait.]]></description><link>manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-01-draft.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Projects/Writing/Books/The Cleric Saga/_bmad-output/manuscript/active_drafts/chapter-01-draft.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:17:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[intro]]></title><description><![CDATA["The Cleric Saga", Book oneC.M.

A NOTE FROM THE CLERICBefore you start flipping through this particular chronicle of magical malpractice and bureaucratic nonsense, my legal "representation"--which currently consists of a half-eaten sandwich and a stack of suspension notices--insists I lay down some ground rules.The "It’s All Fake" Clause:&nbsp;This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual persons, living, dead, or currently undergoing a messy "Sub-Resurrection Causal Inversion," is entirely coincidental. If you think a character looks like you, take it as a hint to work on your personality. The names, places, and incidents are products of an imagination currently fueled by adrenaline and spite.The Geography of Grime:&nbsp;While this story takes place in a version of the modern world that looks suspiciously like the North Atlantic Magical Federation (shoutout to the damp, gray glory of Woodbridge, NJ), I’ve moved some landmarks around. If you go looking for a specific alley-clinic to get a bootleg entropy-scrub, don't. I’ve altered the street names to keep the Crimson-armored "phenomenal dunces" from knocking on the wrong doors.The "Don't Be a Statistic" Warning:&nbsp;You’re going to see some Old Speech in here. You’re going to read about rites that displace reality like a quantum middle finger to the Standard Model.&nbsp;Do. Not. Attempt. Them.&nbsp;Seriously. If you try to recite an Aria in your bathtub and end up opening a portal to a dimension made of sentient static and bad vibes, that is on you.
