<br>The Root of the 3 C's→ "It may not be fair, but it is just"




<br>


<br>Submission is Serventhood
<br>"Submission is carrying the burden of your brother"


<br>


<br>"One is too small a number to make a difference"


<br>


<br>"You can't change another person, you can only change how you think about them"
<br>Death and Life are in the Power of the Tongue
<br>The Quality of Life you are living today is a product of how you speak to yourself and other people
<br>If you want a greater life, health, relationship, marriage, ANYTHING… you make it with your words
<br>You MUST raise your standards with your words
<br>


<br>"I was wrong"
<br>"I am sorry"
<br>"I'm proud of you"
<br>"I need you"
<br>"I trust you"
<br>"Forgive me"


<br>"When you argue with a fool, now there are two"

<br>Mental Leaks need to be fixed in order for your boat to move forward
<br>Mental Leaks → Self Limiting Beliefs
<br>Mental Blocks are not congenital, they are environmental
<br>There's a difference in being poor, and being broke

<br>Poor is a state of mind, broke is a temporary situation


<br>Your Potential is Limitless, your output, however, is controlled by your "Self-Limiting Beliefs"
<br>You are in control of you


<br>
"Do crackheads go out and say 'Oh I can't get high today, I'm too poor'? NO. They go out and make shit happen!"<br>
<br>
- Annie Uttara Kumar
<br>
<br>


<br>"I am not good enough" → "I am better than that"

<br>You can't be another person without being a 2nd-class version of them → you can only be a 1st-class YOU


<br>"What will my friends think?"
<br>"I don't have what it takes"
<br>


<br>It SUCKS to not be where you want in life. You need to embrace that feeling




<br>Do you greet the day with "Good morning!" Or "GOOD LORD IT'S MORNING"
<br>Once you learn to take note of the things you are grateful for, you will start to forget about the things that you lack. And eventually, you will make up for those as well.
<br>


<br>Formal education will get you educated. Self-education will make you wealthy
<br>


<br>


<br>Judgemental Listening → Jumping to conclusions about the person you are listening to
<br>Selecting Listening → Only listening to what you want to hear; only responding to the content that is of your particular interest
<br>Impatient Listening → Waiting for the other person to finish speaking before you 
<br>Egocentric Listening → Turning the conversation to oneself
<br>Patronizing Listening → Pretending you are listening when you are not
<br>Stubborn Listening → Listening but already having made up your mind




<br>


<br>You need to trust people to be trustworthy




<br><br>
<br>There is strength in struggle

"The basics of building any business is making money"

<br>Sugeet Ajmani

<br>Nobody gives a **hoot** who you are; they are either looking or not looking<br>
<br>I am realizing I am no longer afraid of people saying no. I have some apprehension in working hard and not getting anywhere, but I know that that's just in my head.

<br>Nothing of value was built overnight; you have to be ready to invest the time
<br>MEETINGS AND DOING YOUR PV DO NOT GUARANTEE SUCCESS
<br>There are some laws you can not beat or break; you cannot get something for nothing

<br>If you call your upline, your business is growing. If your upline calls you, their business is growing
<br>If you want to deal with your past, take a marker, draw a line behind you, and tell yourself "I'm never going back"

<br>Is the ability to accomplish your goals a decision, or a skill?
<br>VCS Requirements

<br>Customer's Name

<br>"Being All In"
<br>When you can go through everything, and still have a smile on your face, and a positive attitude, that's when you know you are all in, and that you are on the right path
<br><br><br>
<br>The point of building this business (or indeed in Succeeding in anything) is to do it with enough frequency and consistency to reap results. The most fundamental quality this requires is tolerance for failure 
<br>Accept the things you can not control, and identify the things you can. The things you can control, are the things you wake up every day and fight for, because that's a fight you can win
<br>Extreme Ownership

<br>Position yourself in such a way that you are profitable no matter what you do in your business

<br>At the Follow Up Stage, you are already 80% of the way there
<br>Be sure to provide your candidate with talks and ensure that they have taken the time to listen to them

<br>If someone is NOT ready to learn (i.e. did not listen to the talks), they are not ready for entrepreneurship
<br>Ask them questions about what their takeaways were


<br>Addressing Questions<br>
<br>Write down the questions that they have
<br><br>"If we are able to answer most if not all of these questions today, what, if anything, would stop you from getting started today?"
– Mansoor Wahidi

SESSION TWO
– Saturday, August 10th, 2024


<br><br>Professionals in the Business<br><br><br>
<br>If you ask a professional what their idea of the "Perfect Job" is, they will most likely say the following:

<br>No Boss
<br>No Alarm Clock
<br>No Commute
<br>No Discrimination
<br>No "Getting Laid Off"
<br>No Stress


<br>In most cases, achieving this requires creating some sort of asset-based income
<br><br>How to Consistently Create Customers<br><br><br>
<br>Ask your loyal customers if they know anyone who the products you have given them will benefit
<br>Get to know your products so you know what to recommend to people based on their needs
<br><br>The Power of Unity<br><br><br>
<br>Your upline has your best interest at heart
<br>The opposite of unity is not division, although that is a byproduct. It's chaos and destruction
<br><br>The Power of Submission<br><br><br>
<br>Being in submission puts you in a position of Power → Your mentor will be careful in ensuring that you succeed because they know that you will do what they say
<br>"Advice that is not asked for is criticism."
– Nidhi Bhattacharyya
<br>
<br>Huddle with your upline the first opportunity you get every month
<br>When your upline becomes a coach and a mentor rather than you're friend, you are truly in submission
<br><br>The Power of the Spoken Word<br><br><br>
<br>We all live at the level of what and how we speak
<br>
<br><br>Products &amp; People<br>
<br>Our business has two pillars: products and people

<br>Without products, our business produces no compensation
<br>Without people, our business can not move products


<br>Everyone has a network that they have the opportunity to maximize for their own benefit, and the benefit of those in their network
<br><br><br><br>Putting Together a Q12 Business<br>
<br>Putting together a team of 40 people is a solid Q12 Business
<br>Are you taking the time to build the connections with the people you are working with?

SESSION THREE

<br><br>Achievement Vs. Success<br><br><br>
<br>Sometimes the way we chase progress is wrong
<br>Achievement Vs Success

<br>Success is a trend → a POINT on that trend is an achievement or a setback
<br>Failure only happens when you stop

<br>Creating Mental Momentum

<br>Competence creates Competence

<br>When you are talking to people about this business, do they see the value in what you are talking about?
<br>Are you creating an environment of gratitude and appreciation among your team, and helping them understand what this business opportunity can offer them?


<br>Does your self talk and "non-self talk" align with your goals?


<br>Patience is a source of strength

<br>Aki &amp; Selena Kimura - BSM Xstream Pro
<br>Bashir &amp; Moona Mohamud

<br>You either make excuses or results, never both
<br>When you start chasing greatness, suddenly you'll find people against you
<br>Everything you want to start, first talk to someone who has been doing it for 20 years




<br>Everyone NEEDS to have a dream

<br>"A Man Without Vision Shall Perish"

<br>Strong Work Ethic
<br>To make it happen in ANYTHING in life, you have to come up with NON-NEGOTIABLES
<br>All Obstacles and Adversity are there as lessons learned to help you get to your goals
<br>Sacrifice is required for work ethic
<br>Everything in life is a choice


<br>Saji &amp; Sushma Kumar

<br>"There is no Beauty without Strangeness"
<br>A meaningful life, even if it's full of hardship, is very satisfying. A meaningless life is a tough ordeal even if it's easy
<br>What gives meaning to your work?
<br>Two ways to get wisdom - Mistakes, or Mentorship
<br>You do not need to make it impossible to fail. Just make it EASY to do the right thing.
<br>If you are ready to play the game, you need to be ready to listen to what needs to be done


<br>Ali &amp; Maaka Gaashan

<br>God has already provided the answers to all of your prayers, you just have not taken the steps he provided you yet
<br>You do the work, and once in a while, you look back -&gt; Lead by Example

<br>It does not matter what you know, what matters is what you implement and execute
<br>Knowledge without action is the path to Obsoletion
<br><br>
<br>"I put my heart over the bar, and my body followed"

<br>Believe in yourself, once your heart has reached your goal, your business will follow


<br><br>
<br>Keep channels of communication open - often a relationship is impacted more by what is left unsaid than what was said
<br>A person's perception is their reality
<br>You have to unconditionally love yourself, and stop judging yourself
<br>Forgive yourself today - once you respect yourself, you realize that every single human being is THE SAME
<br><br>
<br>Do it, and THEN figure out how you did it

 <br>Speaker: Shivaram Kumar<br>
<br>Intro Slide:<br>
1. Who are you?<br>
2. What do you do?<br>
3. Why are you here?<br>
4. Personal Background<br>
5. Spokes on a Wheel<br>
1. The importance of maintaining the integrity of the "spokes" that hold the wheel of life in shape<br>
1. Family<br>
2. Health<br>
3. Spirituality<br>
4. etc.<br>
2. It is important to STENGTHEN these spokes in the event that one of them breaks or weakens<br>
1. Many people will instead do something like skip the gym because they lost their job, or take out their frustration on others, rather than the correct action of strengthening those things to maintain their life's integrity<br>
1. This is a super good way for me to transition from Personal Background to Business<br>
1. Lost job in Pandemic, saw need to add spokes to my life<br>
6. Advertising is letting people know why they should buy your drill<br>
7. Marketing is letting people know how your drill will help them get what they want ('a hole in the wall')<br>

<br>Success is never built from a place of convience. Convenience leads to mediocrity, because it doesn't require any change. Success requires change -&gt; self-actualized change

<br><br><br>
<br>What is Sustained performance? → Performance that can be duplicated and maintained
<br>What leads to Sustained performance? → Self-Leadership
<br>
Ask yourself: "Are you allowing your perspective to change because the business got tougher for you?"
<br><br><br>
<br>Overthinking → Anything you are thinking that gets in the way of your goal is overthinking
<br>Living in the Past → Preoccupation with how things happened before can lead to burnout
<br>Inability to Deal with Uncertainty → Nothing is guaranteed; You need to be able to handle the ups and downs, and ADAPT
<br><br><br>
<br>Givers → People who prioritize giving to others, without the necessity of having received first
<br>Takers → People who prioritize receiving from others without giving anything in return
<br>Matchers → People who prioritize receiving something from others before they are willing to give anything in return
<br><br><br><br>
<br>


<br>You can't build a large business until &amp; unless you are an effective communicator
<br>For people to receive your message, there needs to be positive intent, and positive impact

 <br>Cues<br><br><br>"You can not compartmentalize what you do in this business to business hours only" 

<br>Khalid Motorwala

<br>
Character is built in the Valleys
<br>
<br>An IBO gets started only when they are activated
<br>The foundation of our business is telling stories and making connections
<br>
The life of an Entrepreneur is Solving Problems Daily
<br>
<br>If you don't invest in yourself, nobody else will

<br>Make sure you are working to get your finances in order → your disposable income is investment capital for your business
<br>Invest in yourself as if your life depends on it → because your business does


<br>Your goal is to duplicate the thought process of the leaders in the business
<br>Dont spend your time and money on frivolous stuff

<br>There will be time for that; the best use of your finances now is to invest it in your financial and personal development


<br>Cost of Retirement →  $3.4 Million

<br>
<br><br><br>Here is the summary that I have written<br>Training focused on strategies for effective e-commerce and team management. Key points included the importance of striving for promotions, maintaining organization, and developing a consistent business rhythm. Attendees were advised to differentiate between activity and productivity, manage their schedules effectively, and set daily goals. Emphasis was placed on adhering to a structured activity plan, receiving guidance from an upline coach, and maintaining daily communication with them. The seminar also highlighted nine core steps, including showing the business plan regularly and ensuring full product use, with specific volume targets for individual and couple IBOs. A motivational quote by Khalid Motorwala underscored the value of perseverance in personal development.

 -Sugeet Ajmani
<br>
<br>Your job this weekend is to get your belief to the extent that you are willing to put in the effort. 
<br>Raising your self-image is the name of the game.

<br>Those with large organizations are those who can raise the self-image of everyone on their team


<br>Speak what you want that you don't currently have → speak into existence the things that you want that are opposed to your current situation
<br>You growth is directly proportional to your willingness to learn

<br>The day that you think that you have NOTHING to learn, your business will start going backward
<br>Your humility will play a big role in your growth

- The best investment you can make is in yourself
- <br><br>Relationships
- Empathy &amp; Understanding
	- Put yourself in other people's shoes
	- Offer support when needed
- Personal growth
	- Associating → Learn what to do, and what not to do, from those who have achieved what you wish to achieve
	- Seek advice from your mentors/coaches/upline
	- Accept constructive criticism
	- Decide to be happy
		- Learn to let go, and move on<br><br>Sacrifice

- Functions in Order of Importance:
	- Amway Trips
- Whatever is not your business, is **none** of your business
- Don't let a little molehill become a mountain because you did not address it when you needed to
- <br><br><br>Write a Short Summary Here<br>My notes center around the concepts of delayed gratification, hard work, empathy, personal growth, and sacrifice. The quotes I've gathered emphasize the importance of turning excuses into reasons, finding purpose through overcoming personal limitations, and discovering oneself through serving others. Notable figures such as Shalu Mahraj, Murli Mahraj, and Mahatma Gandhi underscore these principles.

In the context of achieving success, especially in ventures like going diamond in Amway, I am reminded that the best investment is in oneself, and the journey involves hard work and discipline. From mentors like Naren and Priya Kumar, and Jitsu and Reema Alam, I've learned the significance of empathy, understanding, and continuous personal growth. Sacrifice is also a recurring theme, highlighted by Luna Le's insight that one must sacrifice for their goals, or risk losing them. Finally, the importance of addressing issues promptly to avoid them escalating into major problems is stressed, aligning with the notion that what isn't my business should remain out of my focus.

 <br>Cues<br><br><br><br>Lorem Ipsum Doler
<br><br>Staying Focused<br>"Do the goals that you have set, set you up for bigger goals in the future?"
-Misa Do
<br>
<br>Giving up something GREATER, for something LESSER, is SACRIFICE
<br>Giving up something LESSER, for something GREATER, is INVESTMENT
<br>You can not really stay focused on a goal, in your comfort zone
<br><br>Intangibles of the Business
#### Tangibles
- Car: Jaguar F-Type → $200K
- House:  5000+ Square Feet, 2+ Acres → $1.5 Million
- Children's Education Paid Off → $1.5 Million
- Travel to Every Country in the World → <br><br>
<br>You can not assign a dollar value to the Intangibles
<br>I want to live my life entirely in the present. Free of the burden of the past, and free of fear of the future.
<br>I want to experience everything that is available to me in this life
<br>I want the freedom to spend every day with my wife, children, and family and choose what we do
<br><br>The Golden Principle
- Building a large, successful business is as much about what you do, as it is about what you stand for
- Holding on to your baggage of the past is something that is visible to those you interact with. They can see the burden you carry. And when you are trying to share with them freedom, bearing such a burden only serves to make you a hypocrite. A False Prophet.
	- ==Learn to retain your innocence==<br><br>Width &amp; Depth
- You have not launched ANYBODY until you have launched somebody for them
- You go wide, so THAT you can go deep
- Feel Proud that your upline believes that you are capable of leading this organization<br><br>Skillset
- When you launch someone, granting them the skills to get results is the first priority<br><br>Loyalty
&gt;[!quote] Blood makes you related; Loyalty makes you a family
&gt; -Saji Kumar<br><br>Activation Energy
&gt;[!quote] Every pin in this business has an activation energy; until you create that energy that growth will not show up
&gt; -Ali Gashon<br>
<br>If you are stuck, it is because you are confusing the difference between you, and your thoughts. 
<br>Results come when what you do is aligned with why you are doing it
<br>You cannot have a hard head, and a soft heart
<br><br>How to Be Happy<br>
<br>An average IBO does not go Diamond; so how do you differentiate yourself from where you at to where you want to go?

<br>Belief &amp; Action


<br><br>
<br>6 Businesses at T10 BBI and Above

<br>Ruby Volume will be done


<br>Learn to Sponsor
<br>Character is shown when you are in the Valleys, not when you are on the mountaintop
<br>Stop Judging
<br>Depth is not hard; it is about friendships
<br>Happiness
&gt;[!quote] Happiness is within us; it's already there. Stop searching.
&gt; -Sugeet Ajmani<br>
<br>You need to search within yourself to find what is destroying your happiness
<br>It is your responsibility to make yourself happy
<br>Misery is self-created; no one can make you miserable
<br>Happiness is in the process of accomplishing a worthwhile goal in the service of mankind
<br>The more you create resistance to life, the more you will have to fight to live
<br>Eet eez wut Eet eez
<br>Happiness is in the love of the work you do
<br>
<br><br><br>Here is the summary that I have written

<br>How many people have I met one-on-one | how many new friendships have I developed
<br>Write down your goals for the month &amp; rate yourself on the 9 core steps
<br>Go 2 deep for every 1 wide

<br>This is not limited to your personal legs, drive depth IN the leg at a 2 to 1 ratio of depth and width
<br>Depth requires A|B-List


<br>Thoughts are things, but most thougts are fake - thoughts about the past or future are simply a perspective. The only thing that truly has any significance are the thoughts we HAVE about those things IN THE MOMENT
<br>How to stop overthinking - if it makes you feel bad, acknowledge it, and let it go
<br>Draw your group out EVERY DAY
<br>Unseen controls the seen
<br>If you really believe in it, there will be ways that it will happen
<br><br><br>
<br>"Get Lost in the Song"

<br>It's not the mechanics
<br>Less than 10% of your interaction with people should be "instruction"
<br>Feeling "superior" in your technical ability compared to your downlines is a massive detriment - you need to TRUST them to do work on their own and to make mistakes and figure it out the same way you did


<br>Creating a pull

<br>The top-most level of leadership is "WHO YOU ARE"

<br>Start setting up weekly power hour

<br>Need to make brainstorm ways to make these more appealing to them AND me


<br>Want to grow to the point of a weekly huddle for my team




<br>If you don't have a local group, it is very difficult to be productive, since you are limited by zoom

<br>F2F Contacting, increase focus on NJ/NY/CT/PA Area


<br>Whoever comes up with a goal has to come up with a plan

<br><br>
<br>Embracing hardship as a test of character and use them as rising to the occasion.
<br>Leaders are keepers and communicators of the vision. Bear the responsibility for always seeing the big picture and helping their people to see it.
<br>Values are the heart of your character and your leadership.
<br>Leaders role is not to control people or stay on top of things, but rather guide, energize and excite.
<br>Good leaders deal successfully with the diversity and differences of their team and leverage the for the benefit of the team and organization.
<br><br><br>
<br>
<br><br><br>So true right so true and and what happens is that and people wonder how come I run into these problems all the time have you seen some some people are like they have problems all the time can we shut this off yeah they have problems all the time right and this is what happens it's like it starts building up because you you keep verbalizing the same things over and over again and guess what happens the energy stays with you but in contrast if you start you know people say I'm not motivated to do the work have you have you heard that right now people think that motivation creates momentum but might be true but can momentum create motivation right like I'll give you an example somebody's in very high momentum okay so so Nisha have there been days that you got up in the morning and you didn't want to go into work yeah did you still go in yeah have you tried calling up your boss and saying can you motivate me because I don't feel motivated enough to come in can you try that on Monday yeah you will yeah your boss will be okay with that no he might be mad okay don't try it then yeah she's still willing to try no don't try it don't try it you know naturally we know that now what happens to a lot of people see that's why I played that what happens to a lot of people is that something goes wrong in their business something goes against their expectation and suddenly they feel low and they carry this low energy around and guess what happens they attract more of the same frequency right and they start thinking negative and suddenly they all they have so if you had three people in your team and one person quit or stop showing up suddenly you're some younger people in your team-looking lean. OH 111 biologyaci 05455 healthcare HA isn't the chance tobok you but you but you
 starting to think negative, right? And you start attracting negative energy and before you know it, the two people who were there, they don't, they don't feel good being around you. So always, you know, before you say something or before you think something or when you are thinking something, here's what you have to think also is that where am I going with this? Am I headed in the positive direction or am I headed in the negative direction? Because remember one thing, now you might think, oh, that's not, it's all stupidity, but what if it was true? Right? Now there is a boxing match happening tonight. Right? Mike Tyson is boxing who? Jake Paul. Jake Paul. Jake Paul. Who is he? Who's Jake Paul? A YouTuber. Okay. Yeah. YouTuber who's working on. Now, I watched an interview. The lady is asking, so this guy who posted this also posted the other, other video and he says, it talks about manifestation and how old is Mike Tyson? 58 years old. And how old is that Jake? 27, 28 years old. Okay. So this lady, right? Press reporter. She's asking Mike Tyson, sir, what if you lose? He looks at her, says, I'm going to win. Yes, yes, sir. But what if you lose? Lady, you didn't hear me. I'm going to win. Yes, sir. I understand. But I am going to win. So a lady behind that reporter touched her and said, okay, stop it.
 Because he was getting upset. He was getting upset. And then there's a comment below. This is how he has been from day one. From day one. Now I don't know what the results are going to be. I don't care. But what I'm saying is that that's how you think. That's how you think. And you know what? When is it difficult? When things are going great? It's easy. When things are going in the other direction. That's when it decides. That's when your character shows up. That's when your character shows up. Right? And when you start focusing on little things. Sometimes people start. You know when there are things not going right for them. They start focusing on other people's business. What's the statement that we make about other people's business? What is not your business is none of your business. Now let me tell you. The logic behind that. Because I never like to say something to people and not explain why we say that. Because the thing is we don't know what somebody is going through. We don't know why their business looks the way it looks. Right? And it does not benefit us. Because it will make us think. Negative. Or not so positive. Do we want that? No. No. And how does it matter? How would you like it if you walk into somebody's house and the first question they ask is, so how much do you make? Do we seh all know that that's offensive platform turns out? It's the same thing here. So when you walk into a meeting here, you cannot ask anybody. So how many people do you have in your group? Because it's not going to help you anyway. Because if they were thriving and growing, we would all be talking about it. You don't have to ask. The fact that you are asking tells me that you got doubt. And you're looking to stabilize or strengthen.
 Lengthen that doubt. You're looking for facts. Yes, I'm right. Yeah, it does not work. See, because why do you need to look into somebody else's business? Because it's not going to help you anyway. So why ask that question in the first place? So, you know, I come to know somebody's energy. As soon as I'm with somebody and they start asking me about somebody else's business or talking about somebody else's business, I know this person is not going anywhere. Not going anywhere. Not because they are not good people, but the way they're thinking is wrong. The way they're thinking is wrong because they are interested in somebody else's business. Marcel, you bumped into somebody, right? For contacting, right? He was from some other team that left BWW. And what did you ask me? Why did they leave? And what did I say, Marcel? Same thing. Same thing. I said, don't worry about it. None of my business. I don't know what transpired there, but I don't care. My plan is still here. That's all I care. Because last time Papalado came and did a plan for me, was never. You get what I'm saying. So how does it matter to me who comes, who goes, who stays, who grows? Growing? Yeah, it helps. But growing, I already come to know. Right? When they got up, who was that? Jitu and Neelam. And said, you got 11 legs. Right? That you come to know. Because that is showcased. Nobody is showcasing people. Look at this guy. Nobody. He has nobody on his team. Right? Nobody is talking about that. Because you know what? Nobody wants to know. And you should not want to know also. Right? So don't worry about it. Don't probe. I never asked Sugit. So what happened to that other leg of yours? He's not coming around. First of all, it is embarrassing to Sugit. I don't know.
 Secondly, is it going to help me? Then how does it? It's going to probably hurt you. If at all anything, it's going to hurt me because I'm going to start thinking negatively. And like he said, I'm going to start attracting negative. Right? So why worry about it? And the other thing is, when he talks about positive, you have to seem positive also. Right? You have to seem happy. If you got this constipated look like you really want to rush to the bathroom, nobody wants to be around you. You might be serious about the business. Have you seen some people are very serious about the business? But you see the seriousness on their face also. Right? I don't want to be around them. Right? You want to have fun. You want to have some great jokes. Yeah. I mean. Happy Thanksgiving. Right? Right? Have fun. Enjoy. This should seem like you are enjoying the process of building the business because the business will grow if you are having fun with it. But have fun while working the business also. There is work involved. Right? There is work involved. And don't worry about what other people are saying. Do you know what echo chamber is? Okay. It's an analogy they use for dogs. So dogs, some dogs cannot realize their own echoes. So they might sit there, lazing around and they bark. Just generally. Oh! Right? They hear their bark coming back. They say, oh, there is seriously something wrong. Oh! Oh! Oh! You also think there is something wrong? Oh! Oh! Oh! And now the whole neighborhood dogs are barking. The one who started it does not even know why he started it. Right? That's called echo chamber. So a lot of people are living in this echo chamber of negativity. Right? They are looking for things. Is somebody barking? Then I want to bark also. Right? The first person who started the bark does not even know why he started. Right? The first person who started the bark does not even know why he started.
 And that's the story. So don't worry about that. Focus on your business work hard. We are Sushma and I are headed tomorrow 8 AM in the morning. I don't know whether Mohit and Koki are you on, please make sure they don't forget. Otherwise we'll be stranded here. Our plane will take off with all the bags. Okay. They are supposed to come pick us up at 8 AM in the morning. If he doesn't show up, I will show up. I know, but. Because I'm up at 4 AM. You are always up at. Now he can work out with our bags. Right? Oh yeah, he has a 5.30 AM plan. Happily the man's been contacting everywhere and he suddenly says, Saji, so when it is 2 PM, 2 PM in India, that's a good time for us to show the plan. I said only if you're not sleeping because it's 3.30 in the morning here. 3.30 in the morning. Why is it? No, Saji, it's not 3.30 in the morning. I said, it is 3.30 in the morning. Oh, I thought it would be 6 AM. No, he thought it was 12.30 AM. Yeah, he thought it was 12.30. Right after pace. Other way. It's a right after pace. I'll show the plan. But then he set it up for 5.30 AM. 5.30 AM. Wow. Wow. Right? So it's how you look at things. Everything is about how you look at things. Everything. It doesn't matter whether your business is going forward, whether it's life, unless you have a life threatening, something happening. Right? Let's find the good in everything that's going on in our life. Everything. Because there is some good. Right? You might have to look hard sometimes. Right? But there is something good all the time. And that's how you become the person that attracts everyone. Since you started off on this, I want to cover another cardinal rule. So we have, we are in a people business and we want to make sure everybody is comfortable with the vibe we have here. Right? So there are some cardinal rules that have been put into place mainly to protect ourselves.
 and protect others who are becoming part of our team. So this, what Saji just mentioned is a cardinal rule which is don't embarrass anyone. This is an embarrassing question, so don't embarrass anyone. Now another cardinal rule is about being alone with a person of the opposite gender. And I'll tell you why that is in place. To be honest, when I heard it first, I thought how archaic is that cardinal rule? How archaic is that? We're in such modern ages and how can you place such a cardinal rule and explain why? And off once in a while is not such an issue. But if week after week, if I was going to travel to the APA hotel with Ashwin, first he'll eat all my food. But besides that problem, here's what happens. Two individuals traveling, just the two of them, right? Traveling together. Before you know it, you are talking about yourself and opening up to that other person. And you know, who knows? Who knows what kind of feelings are going to develop? Maybe in just one person. And then that's going to make the other person uncomfortable. Right? Or let's say you are like SK is here and Mrs. Santosh is not here. And if she or Marcel's example, right? Alicia cannot come to PACE on Fridays because she works in a beauty salon and one of their busiest days is Fridays. How secure would she feel if every week Marcel was driving to the meeting for an hour and a half each way with another woman?
 Right? So those are things that are thought of and that is why these cardinal rules are in place. So if I had to give a right to Ashwin, bad example here because we adhere to the cardinal rules but if I had to give a right to Ashwin I would make sure either another male or another female was in the car. So there's three people in the car and… Chiara. A female. No, definitely not Ayaan because he and Ashwin will eat my food. But do you see the point here? Right? Now if what I said here does not make sense to you, please have a discussion with one of us about the importance of sticking to the cardinal rules because there is value, there is a lot of value in that. Yes, it's so much easier to not take this into account and whenever you want hop into someone's car. An off situation here and there is not the problem. It's a problem when you… And that's why… When Brittany needs a right, what we try to do is we keep moving her around like a football team to other people's car. Right? I mean… Yeah, I mean the thing is that she wants to come to the meeting. She lives quite far from here but she wants to show up. That is amazing. That is phenomenal. A lot of people will make an excuse and say I log in online, you know, but she wants to come. So we make sure that she gets a ride and we try to make sure that she's not going with the same person for a long time. Because you know, we want to make sure that we are teaching the right things. That's… Okay? We are taking out for Brittany when we do that. Yeah. And I'll explain why. Let's say it was someone like Jackie. I'm saying the jokes, right? Sometimes people make jokes that are not appropriate. That might just be them. What… … … … … … … … … …
 What if it was making Britney uncomfortable? Right? You don't know. You don't know. There are certain jokes that a person of another gender might make or just another whatever origin might make. But having a third person in there hopefully diffuses the situation so it's not just the two of you arguing about politics or something totally unrelated to this business. And that is why we say this about two people who might not be platinums, who might not have the maturity of having led a team travelling together. So can we make an effort to understand this and even if you don't understand it just say okay I'm just going to do it because even though it does not make sense I'll just do it. That's what we did in the beginning. It made no sense. We said you know what? A lot of things they talked about as far as the rules were concerned did not make sense to us. But we said you know what? I want a business. We want a business. We want a growing team. The last thing we want is to create confusion. I didn't want to be a rebel and fail in the business. You know? What am I going to prove? Yeah. Right? There was no cause that I was fighting for. I was not Martin Luther King. Right? So. We knew for a fact that abiding by the cardinal rules was not going to stop us from building a large team. So why not do it? Right. So while we are on that topic, let me also tell you. So let's say Alex, you are at the function and let's say somebody from Tanmay and Rashmi's team know that you live in Jersey City and they come up to you and ask you for a ride. First thing you have to do is say, I am going in that direction, but let me check with my upline. Now he, so does that mean Saket can tell you that? Okay. Yeah. It's okay for you to take that person. No. You know why? Tell me why.
 Alex. Yeah. It's they say you have to be able to get the common upline involved. What does the common upline mean? That means Sushma is one leg. I am one leg and the common upline. So who's the common upline between Tanmay Rashmi and Saket? Till Sugit is aware and gives the green signal. You cannot take that. Why? Tell me why. Hold on, Sushma. This is the people who... You got your chance. You had the mic. Did you hear me jumping in? Did you hear me jumping in? Okay, that's good. Okay, yeah. No, I'm guessing he would know whatever stuff is going on. Yeah. No, but Sushma is right. What if that guy is a serial killer? Or what if that guy is like, you know, he carries... No. Like small packets with him all the time. Or has a warrant on his name. Or a warrant on his name. Who knows? You don't know. But I know every person in this room. Every person. And I also know what's going on in their life. For the most part. For the most part. For the people who talk to me. Right? Now, because you might crack a joke about... Oh, this husband and wife. They are fighting, man. And this guy's five and him might be fighting. Yeah. Right? So I just told the India team this morning. I said, unless you are a platinum. Don't give advice on house buying. Marriages. Or anything. Don't go and tell somebody that... I think you should change your wife. Right? Because... Now, you are laughing at all this. But let me tell you. We had a situation. Not changing wife. But somebody... Some guy was not coming to the meeting on time. Right? He was always late.
 core guy big pin this other big pin asked him so no no no just ask just asked him hey how come you don't come on time he said oh because i have this job situation and this guy is like pretty high level okay his job is like he's like a senior vp or something like some like sakit so he said my job you know nowadays we have a situation because of which i am running a little late so he said you should change your job forget his own downline he's telling cross lane also so just be careful right just be careful and the other the thing is we don't market anything within our team and if i come to know that you know sriman bought something at a huge discount that and i'm also looking for it and if i asked sriman then that's fine but sriman cannot just because he got a discount go ahead and tell everybody i got a discount or i got a discount do you want a discount do you want a discount and build a connection with that guy saying okay you give them 20 give me 10 out of that right this is no no other deals should happen here okay we should remember all that and why do we do the meetings tell me to grow our business how do we grow our business new people new people let's all work on making sure this team grows to a our goal was 100 people right 100 people this year we still got time we can do it i mean i know a lot of people couldn't come today i know ritual is still on the screen he's getting better did you learn any are you sitting on the floor or something look she's pretty low right i guess she's behind that's why now she's yeah see no no so a ritual must be sitting on a ladder or something okay so still still still still still
 Okay. You know, I see a lot of people. Now here's another thing. We are one team. Our message is grow. Let's all grow. This time Sushma and I are going on Achievers. Let me tell you. Yesterday, Sushma was asking me, talking to somebody about doing a meeting. And I said, let's do it this Saturday. Sushma said, but this Saturday, we are not here. This is yesterday. And I'm thinking, where are we going this Saturday? Yeah. So he looks at his calendar. Every time he's talking to someone, he's going through his calendar. He says, Saturday is open. Let's do it. He promised like 10 people meetings on Saturday and Sunday. You know why? If you guys all were going with me or a lot of you were going with me, I would not forget. I would not forget. Can you promise to join with us? Yes. Okay. Pick a year guys. Pick 25, pick 26, pick 27. But we want you with us. Because this one, we didn't go to the last one. Right? We didn't want to go. This one, we didn't want to go also. I had a big long conversation with Sugit. Saying, I'm not coming. He said, no, you have to come. You have to build dreams for your team. But we need you with us. I know next year, we got PK and Sonia going with us. We know, Michelle going with us. Right? Michelle and Robin coming with us. To San Diego. And we know that next, the year after that, a whole bunch more of you will come. Right? We want you with us. Okay? Because there's no, it's no fun. I mean, rides and all. I don't do rides and all. If you guys come, then I'll go. Even if I'm scared, I'll go on the rides. Just to see how scared you are. Okay? So with that, we are done. Here's back to our amazing host, Jackie!
